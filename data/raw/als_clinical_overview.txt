Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder aﬀecting
primarily the motor system, but in which extra-motor manifestations are
increasingly recognized. The loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the
motor cortex, the brain stem nuclei and the anterior horn of the spinal cord
gives rise to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. ALS often has a focal
onset but subsequently spreads to diﬀerent body regions, where failure of res-
piratory muscles typically limits survival to 2–5 years after disease onset. In
up to 50% of cases, there are extra-motor manifestations such as changes in
behaviour, executive dysfunction and language problems. In 10%–15% of
patients, these problems are severe enough to meet the clinical criteria of fron-
totemporal dementia (FTD). In 10% of ALS patients, the family history sug-
gests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The remaining 90% have
no aﬀected family members and are classiﬁed as sporadic ALS. The causes of
ALS appear to be heterogeneous and are only partially understood. To date,
more than 20 genes have been associated with ALS. The most common
genetic cause is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene,
responsible for 30%–50% of familial ALS and 7% of sporadic ALS. These
expansions are also a frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia, emphasizing
the molecular overlap between ALS and FTD. To this day there is no cure or
eﬀective treatment for ALS and the cornerstone of treatment remains multi-
disciplinary care, including nutritional and respiratory support and symptom
management. In this review, diﬀerent aspects of ALS are discussed, including
epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diﬀerential diagnosis,
investigations, treatment and future prospects.
Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was originally
deﬁned as a pure motor neuron disease by Jean-
Martin Charcot in 1869 but is now recognized as a
multisystem neurodegenerative disorder, with disease
heterogeneity at the clinical, genetic and neuropatho-
logical level [1–3].
The clinical presentation of ALS typically consists
of adult onset focal muscle weakness and wasting,
which
has
a
tendency
to
spread
with
disease
progression. The weakness most commonly starts in
the limb muscles, more often in distal muscles than in
proximal muscles. In about 25%–30% of cases there
is a bulbar onset of the disease, presenting with dysar-
thria, dysphagia, dysphonia, or more rarely with mas-
seter weakness. There is a high degree of variability in
the age at onset, the site of onset and the disease
progression rate of ALS. The disease is relentlessly
progressive in most patients, with a median survival
of about 3 years after symptom onset, where death is
mostly attributed to respiratory failure. About 50% of
patients will suﬀer from extra-motor manifestations to
some degree in addition to their motor problems. In
10%–15% of cases, an additional diagnosis of fron-
totemporal dementia (FTD) can be made [4], whilst

35%–40% of patients will have mild behavioural and/
or cognitive changes. FTD is characterized by the
degeneration of frontal and anterior temporal lobes
and presents clinically by behavioural changes, impair-
ment of executive functioning and/or language impair-
ment [5]. ALS and FTD are now considered to be
two ends of a spectrum due to the overlap in molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying both neurodegenerative
disorders [6].
At the genetic level there is considerable disease
heterogeneity as well, with more than 20 genes that
have been associated with ALS. The ﬁve most com-
mon genetic causes are hexanucleotide expansions in
chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) and
mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR
DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), fused in sar-
coma (FUS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1).
Together, they explain about 15% of all patients
[1–3].
The most common neuropathological signature of
ALS is cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, a protein
encoded by TARDBP, which is found in more than
95% of ALS cases [7]. TDP-43 inclusions are not
unique to patients with mutations in TARDBP, but
are also present in patients with C9orf72 expansions
or with TBK1 mutations and in patients with sporadic
ALS (sALS). TDP-43 is predominantly localized to
the nucleus under basal conditions, but in ALS it mis-
localizes to the cytoplasm to form aggregates and
become phosphorylated. Other aggregating proteins,
such as SOD1 and FUS, are found in patients bearing
SOD1 and FUS mutations, respectively. Patients with
C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions have accu-
mulations of dipeptide repeat proteins which are
translated from the GGGGCC repeats, although this
repeat is located in a non-coding region of the gene.
The diagnosis of ALS remains a clinical diagnosis
and is based on the presence of both upper motor
neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN)
signs, in patients with progressive muscle weakness in
whom no alternative explanation can be found. Most
clinicians do not rely on the available revised El Esco-
rial criteria [8] or the Awaji algorithm [9], as these cri-
teria
lack
sensitivity,
rather
capturing
disease
progression and only indirectly diagnostic certainty
[10]. Moreover, these criteria have been developed for
research purposes to select patients for participation
in clinical trials. There is a high need for clinical diag-
nostic criteria of ALS and related subtypes of motor
neuron disease, to reduce the diagnostic delay, which
is unfortunately still often up to a year after disease
onset. Recently, new simpliﬁed diagnostic criteria for
ALS have been proposed, requiring only combined
UMN and LMN dysfunction in one body region, or
LMN
dysfunction
in
at
least
two
regions
[11].
Whether this will reduce the diagnostic delay requires
further study.
The only European Medicines Agency approved
drug to treat ALS is riluzole, a glutamate antagonist,
which has a small but signiﬁcant eﬀect on survival in
ALS [12]. Despite the ever-growing knowledge about
the causes and disease mechanisms underlying ALS,
more than 40 randomized clinical trials have been
negative [13]. There are many potential reasons for
this lack of success, but treating ALS as one disease
regardless of the underlying cause or disease mecha-
nisms involved may be one of them.
Epidemiology
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has an estimated inci-
dence of 1.75–3 per 100 000 persons per year and a
prevalence of 10–12 per 100 000 in Europe, but signif-
icant geographical diﬀerences exist [14–16]. The inci-
dence amounts to 4–8 per 100 000 persons per year in
the age group with the highest risk of developing ALS
(45–75 years). Mean age at onset of symptoms is vari-
able: 58–63 years for sALS and 40–60 years for famil-
ial ALS (fALS) [14]. An estimation of the cumulative
lifetime risk for developing ALS is 1:350 in men and
1:400 in women [17,18]. Men have a higher risk of
developing sporadic limb onset ALS compared to
women; the global sex ratio is 1.2–1.5 [19].
Aetiology
Similar to other neurodegenerative conditions, ALS is
thought to be caused by a combination of genetic fac-
tors, environmental factors and aging-related dysfunc-
tion. At the genetic level, more than 20 genes have
been linked with the disease to date, and it is antici-
pated that more genetic factors will be discovered.
The genetic architecture of ALS appears complex,
where monogenetic mutations with high eﬀect size
currently explain about 15% of patients, but where
common and rare genetic variants with low and mod-
erate eﬀect size seem to contribute to the risk of
developing ALS as well. The overall heritability of
ALS is high; in patients with sALS the heritability is
estimated to be 30%–60% [18,20]. The risk of devel-
oping ALS doubles in ﬁrst degree relatives of ALS
patients [20].
Autosomal dominant causes of ALS
In 1993, the ﬁrst ALS-related gene was discovered:
SOD1, responsible for 20% of fALS and 1%–2% of
sALS [21]. Mutations in this gene do not cause ALS

by loss of SOD1 function but rather by rendering the
protein prone to aggregation, which disturbs multiple
important cellular functions.
In 2008 and 2009, mutations in TARDBP and FUS,
the genes encoding the RNA-binding proteins TDP-43
and
FUS,
were
discovered.
These
mutations
are
responsible for 3%–5% of fALS and for <1% of
sALS
[22–25].
In
2011,
C9orf72
was
discovered,
responsible for 30%–50% of fALS and for 7%–10%
of sALS [26,27]. Patients with hexanucleotide repeat
expansions in C9orf72 are more likely to get bulbar
onset ALS and to have cognitive and behavioural
impairment as well.
Mutations in TBK1 are most probably the ﬁfth
most common cause of autosomal dominant ALS,
responsible for about 1% of patients [28,29] but up to
10% of patients with ALS-FTD [30].
Although most SOD1 mutations have a high pene-
trance, the other genes mentioned are known to have
a reduced penetrance, which complicates genetic coun-
selling. Rarely, patients carry mutations in more than
one of these genes, suggesting that ALS can be oli-
gogenic in origin [31].
Using next-generation sequencing, several rare vari-
ants in additional genes have been identiﬁed [1–3].
Whilst mutations in many of these genes are rarely
identiﬁed as the cause of ALS, they appear to cluster
in some emerging disease pathways (Fig. 1).
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk factors
Only few genetic risk factors for ALS have been iden-
tiﬁed. An at risk genotype is UNC13A [32], and inter-
mediate repeat expansions in ATXN2 increase the risk
of getting ALS [33,34].
Apart from genetic factors, age and male sex
increase the risk for ALS. Several studies have sug-
gested environmental risk factors for ALS, such as
Figure 1 Clustering of ALS genes in pathogenic pathways. (1) Mutations in TBK-1, OPTN, SQSTM1 (= p62), UBQLN2, C9orf72 and
VCP aﬀect the protein degradation pathways and may contribute to TDP-43 accumulation. (2) Mutations in TARDBP, FUS,
MATR3, TIA1, hnRNPA1, hnRNA2B1 and ATXN2 may all aﬀect RNA metabolism. (3) Mutations in TUBA4A, PFN1, KIF5A and
DCTN1 alter cytoskeletal dynamics and axonal transport.

smoking, body mass index, physical exercise, occupa-
tional and environmental exposures to metals, pesti-
cides, b-methylamino-L-alanine, head injury and viral
infections [35–37]. However, the causal relationship of
these factors with ALS remains to be established.
Pathogenesis
The neuropathological signature of ALS is character-
ized by loss of the neuromuscular connection, axonal
retraction and subsequent cell death of UMNs and
LMNs, surrounded by astrogliosis and microgliosis,
with ubiquitin-positive inclusions being observed in sur-
viving neurons. TDP-43 is the main component of these
inclusions in more than 95% of ALS patients [7]. TDP-
43 is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein involved in
multiple processes such as transcription, splicing, micro
RNA maturation, RNA transport and stress granule
formation. In line with its nuclear and cytoplasmic
functions, TDP-43 can shuttle between the nucleus and
the cytoplasm, but its localization is mainly nuclear.
Mislocalization to the cytoplasm, leading to nuclear
depletion of TDP-43 along with cytoplasmic protein
aggregation, is a hallmark of ALS [38].
Multiple molecular pathways have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of ALS, such as failure of proteostasis,
excitotoxicity, neuroinﬂammation, mitochondrial dys-
function and oxidative stress, oligodendrocyte dysfunc-
tion, cytoskeletal disturbances and axonal transport
defects, disturbed RNA metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic
transport deﬁcits and impaired DNA repair [2,39].
Interestingly, many of the genes associated with ALS
appear to cluster in key pathways: protein quality con-
trol and degradation, RNA metabolism, and cytoskele-
tal and axonal transport (Fig. 1).
Failure of proteostasis
Protein aggregates or, more likely, their oligomeric
complex precursors disturb normal protein homeosta-
sis and induce cellular stress. Molecular chaperones
can aid in refolding misfolded proteins, but when the
cell is overloaded with misfolded proteins they will be
targeted for degradation after ubiquitination via the
ubiquitin–proteasome system. Alternatively, protein
aggregates can also undergo lysosomal degradation by
the autophagy pathway after binding to p62 (se-
questosome 1).
Multiple ALS-related genes support an important
role for protein aggregation and impaired degradation
as key factors in ALS pathogenesis. Indeed, ubiquilin-2
(UBQLN2) has a role in the delivery of ubiquitinated
proteins to the proteasome [40]. Several other muta-
tions are found in genes involved in cargo recognition
for the autophagy pathway, as they encode proteins
that interact with the ubiquitinated cargo and the pha-
gophore membrane: SQSTM1 (encoding the protein
p62,
which
targets
ubiquitinated
proteins
to
the
phagophore) [41], optineurin (OPTN, functioning as a
receptor for autophagy) [42], TBK1 (activates OPTN
by phosphorylation) [29], valosin-containing protein
(VCP) [43] and the C9orf72 protein [44].
Disturbed RNA metabolism
A remarkable number of RNA-binding proteins are
involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. Identiﬁcation of
mutations in the genes of two related RNA-binding pro-
teins TDP-43 and FUS has introduced the mechanism
of dysregulation of RNA metabolism to ALS [45].
Additional mutations in other RNA-binding proteins
such as angiogenin (ANG), senataxin (STX), matrin-3
(MATR3), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A1
(hnRNPA1) and A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), and ataxin-2
(ATXN2) further support the notion that disrupted
RNA metabolism probably plays an important role in
ALS [46]. Under normal conditions, these proteins reside
predominantly in the nucleus, where they serve impor-
tant functions in transcription, splicing, non-coding
RNA metabolism and micro RNA biogenesis. Hence,
nuclear depletion can be detrimental and induce gross
transcriptome
abnormalities.
Mislocalization
to the
cytoplasm with aggregation may induce toxicity as well.
Cytoskeletal disturbances and axonal transport
defects
Several genetic factors in ALS point toward the
importance of cytoskeletal integrity and axonal trans-
port [47]: proﬁlin-1 (PFN1) and tubulin alpha-4A
(TUBA4A) mutations only rarely cause ALS but were
found to destabilize the tubulin network and cause
axonal transport deﬁcits. The dynactin complex is an
important activator of the dynein motor that stabilizes
the binding of cargoes and modulates motor function.
Point mutations in the gene encoding the dynactin1
(DCTN1) subunit of the dynactin complex may cause
ALS or FTD [48,49]. Mutations in the C-terminus of
kinesin-1, encoded by kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A
(KIF5A), may impair the anterograde transport of
cargoes along the microtubules [50,51].
Clinical features
Clinical presentation
The hallmark of ALS is progressive muscle weakness,
accompanied
by
muscle
atrophy,
fasciculations,

muscle cramps and slowness of movements with mus-
cle stiﬀness. The onset of muscle weakness in ALS is
usually focal and typically spreads to adjacent body
regions. This pattern is compatible with spreading of
disease pathology within the motor system, with neu-
roanatomic propagation within the spinal cord seg-
ments and the motor cortex [52].
The disease usually presents with unilateral distal
muscle weakness and atrophy in upper or lower limb
muscles
(spinal
ALS,
roughly
in
two-thirds
of
patients) or in bulbar muscles (bulbar ALS, in about
one-third of patients). Upper limb onset is most com-
monly in the dominant hand [53], with thenar muscles
being more aﬀected than hypothenar muscles (which
is referred to as the split-hand syndrome) [54], with
early involvement of the ﬁrst interosseous muscle and
ﬁnger extensors more aﬀected than ﬁnger ﬂexors [55].
In the lower limb the anterior tibial muscle is typically
aﬀected earlier in the disease course than the gastroc-
nemius muscle, the hamstrings before the quadriceps
muscles [56].
Bulbar onset ALS presents most commonly with
dysarthria or dysphagia, less commonly with dyspho-
nia, or reduced mouth closure or chewing problems.
Axial muscle weakness with head drop and problems
with posture are common in later stages of the dis-
ease, but rarely can be the presenting symptom. In
about one-third of patients, there can be bouts of
uncontrolled laughing or crying (referred to as a pseu-
dobulbar aﬀect) [57].
In some patients, the muscle weakness is preceded
by a period in which fasciculations, muscle cramps or
mild weight loss has been noted.
On neurological examination, a combination of
signs of UMN and LMN involvement is found in
patients with classic ALS. Signs of LMN involvement
include muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations and
reduced muscle tone. Signs of UMN involvement to
look for include hyperreﬂexia (or retained reﬂexes in
atrophic muscles), increased muscle tone (especially in
upper limb ﬂexors and lower limb extensors) and
slowness of movements (e.g. of tongue movement).
Although the majority of patients can be labelled as
having a classic ALS phenotype with spinal or bulbar
onset, it is increasingly recognized that ALS is clini-
cally a heterogeneous syndrome with distinct motor
and extra-motor manifestations (Fig. 2). There is con-
siderable heterogeneity within the motor manifesta-
tions
of
the
disease
itself
and
the
motor
manifestations
can
be
accompanied
by
variable
degrees of frontotemporal involvement. This results in
diﬀerent phenotypic presentations of the disease which
have diﬀerent disease trajectories. Although no widely
accepted
clinical
criteria
for
the
diﬀerent
ALS
phenotypes exist, there is a growing need for a new
classiﬁcation system using universally accepted terms
to account for the disease heterogeneity in ALS [58].
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes
Many diﬀerent motor phenotypes of ALS exist and
they are mainly classiﬁed based on the relative UMN
versus LMN involvement and the regional distribution
of involvement (Fig. 2) [3,58]. It is important to rec-
ognize the diﬀerent motor phenotypes, as life expec-
tancy varies considerably between subtypes of ALS
[59]. In addition, variable degrees of cognitive and
behavioural impairment can be present.
Subtypes of ALS based on relative UMN versus LMN
involvement
In classic ALS, signs of combined UMN and LMN
loss are present in one or more body regions and most
patients presenting with a motor neuron disease can
be labelled as classic ALS.
Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is characterized by
progressive spasticity and slowing of movements with
isolated UMN signs on clinical examination. There
should be no muscle atrophy or visible fasciculations,
and no signs of denervation on electromyography
(EMG) 4 years from symptom onset [60]. Most com-
monly, the symptoms begin symmetrically in the lower
limbs but can begin in the bulbar region as well. PLS
represents 3%–5% of all motor neuron diseases. PLS
can evolve into ALS, typically within 3–4 years after
disease onset. The median survival of PLS patients is
more than 20 years. Patients with UMN predominant
ALS display some features of LMN involvement but
much less pronounced than the UMN features. They
have a shorter survival compared to PLS, but a
slower disease progression compared to classic ALS.
Lower motor neuron predominant ALS patients
have very limited UMN signs and can have diﬀerent
rates of progression. Progressive muscular atrophy is
characterized by progressive isolated LMN signs with-
out clinical evidence of UMN dysfunction, although
up to 30% of progressive muscular atrophy patients
will develop UMN signs during follow-up.
Subtypes of motor neuron disease based on regional
distribution of involvement
Bulbar ALS is a devastating variant of ALS, charac-
terized by a rapid decline and a median survival of
2 years from disease onset. Bulbar UMN dysfunction
results in spastic dysarthria, which is characterized by
slow, laboured and distorted speech. Bulbar LMN

dysfunction is characterized by tongue wasting and
fasciculation, accompanied by ﬂaccid dysarthria and
dysphagia. Whilst only approximately 30% of patients
present with bulbar symptoms, the majority of ALS
cases eventually suﬀer from speech and swallowing
diﬃculties.
Pseudobulbar palsy is characterized by absent facial
expressions (expressionless face), spastic dysarthria,
and diﬃculty in chewing, dysphagia and tongue pro-
trusion due to spasticity, but no tongue fasciculation
or wasting [61]. As this concerns UMN involvement,
the jaw jerk is exaggerated or clonic. This disorder
should be diﬀerentiated from progressive bulbar palsy,
where the LMNs are aﬀected, although there is no
consensus on this syndrome in the literature.
Mill’s syndrome (hemiplegic variant) describes a
hemiplegic or asymmetrical pattern of involvement.
The symptoms are gradually progressive, and the pro-
gression is frequently more ascending than descending;
the palsy can also involve the facial muscles. Pyrami-
dal signs are usually predominant at the side of hemi-
plegia.
About 3% of patients present with diaphragm
weakness (e.g. dyspnoea at exertion, dyspnoea at rest
or orthopnoea) as the initial problem (respiratory
ALS). The patients with respiratory onset have a poor
prognosis. In axial variant ALS, the disease starts in
paravertebral muscles, with stooped posture as a pre-
senting symptom.
Flail
arm
ALS
(brachial
amyotrophic
diplegia,
man-in-the-barrel
syndrome
or
Vulpian–Bernhardt
syndrome) is a progressive predominantly LMN pat-
tern of weakness in the upper limbs, a mostly sym-
metrical pattern of weakness that typically begins in
proximal muscles with progression to distal involve-
ment.
Bulbar
symptoms
develop
in
up
to
77%.
There is a high male preponderance (male to female
ratio 3:1) [62]. Flail leg ALS is a progressive, asym-
metrical, predominantly LMN pattern of weakness
with distal-onset weakness and wasting of the lower
limbs. There is no signiﬁcant weakness or wasting
in
the
upper
limbs
and
bulbar
region
within
12 months after onset, and progression is slightly
slower compared to classic ALS. Pseudopolyneuritic
ALS
is
characterized
by
distal
weakness
of
the
lower limbs and absence of Achilles tendon reﬂex,
and should be distinguished from peripheral neu-
ropathy.

Subtypes of ALS based on additional frontotemporal
involvement
After Alzheimer’s disease, FTD is the most common
cause of dementia in patients <65 years of age. In about
50% of ALS patients, the degenerative process can
extend to the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, giving
rise to a variable degree of executive dysfunction, lan-
guage impairments or behavioural changes (Fig. 2). If
not speciﬁcally sought for, these changes can go unno-
ticed. The Edinburgh cognitive and behavioural ALS
screen is a useful screening assay to identify frontotempo-
ral dysfunction [63]. About 50% of patients will have
normal cognition but in about 10%–15% of patients a
diagnosis of ALS-FTD can be made, when the criteria
for behavioural variant FTD or criteria for primary pro-
gressive aphasia are fulﬁlled (Table 1). ALS-behavioural
impairment only requires two of six criteria for beha-
vioural variant FTD. ALS without cognitive or beha-
vioural impairment is associated with dysfunction in two
non-executive domains (memory or visuospatial func-
tions), whilst ALS-cognitive impairment is associated
with impairment on two tests for executive function [64].
Prediction of prognosis
Life expectancy in ALS is extremely variable. Many dif-
ferent clinical features, already present at ﬁrst disease pre-
sentation, are known to be associated with a shorter
survival. They include a bulbar onset, a short diagnostic
delay, a fast functional decline [e.g. as measured by the
revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)
decline], a pronounced loss of weight (or body mass
index), the presence of FTD, an older age at the onset of
symptoms and a low forced vital capacity. Moreover,
genetic factors also inﬂuence survival. Some monogenetic
causes are associated with a shorter survival (Ala5Val
mutation in SOD1, C9orf72 repeat expansion, P525L
mutation in FUS), but common and rare variants with
eﬀects on survival have been described as well. For exam-
ple, homozygosity for the C allele of rs12608932 in
UNC13a is associated with a shorter survival [65].
The ﬁrst personalized prediction models have been
developed which can estimate the survival outcome in
individual patients based on a combination of clinical
parameters [66]. Such tools are valuable for patient
selection or stratiﬁcation in clinical trials and may
become important for personalized risk estimation
and planning of care.
Important differential diagnoses
The diagnosis of ALS in patients with a typical disease
presentation is relatively straightforward and is based on
the recognition of signs of UMN and LMN degenera-
tion, in the presence of a progressively worsening spread
of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions
(Fig. 2). However, in patients with very early disease pre-
sentations, with slow disease progression or with concur-
rent central or peripheral nervous system disorders, the
diagnosis can be challenging. The probability of misdiag-
nosis, the so-called ‘ALS mimicking syndromes’, is about
7%–8% [67]. The ALS mimicking syndromes should be
ruled out as delay in treatment may have an unfavour-
able eﬀect on outcome.
For patients with predominant UMN or LMN
involvement,
the
diﬀerential
diagnosis
becomes
broader. In patients with predominant UMN involve-
ment, a cervical radiculomyelopathy, hereditary spas-
tic
paraplegia,
adrenomyeloneuropathy
and
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis should be considered.
In the case of pure LMN features, the diagnosis of
plexopathy,
peripheral
neuropathy
(e.g.
multifocal
motor neuropathy with conduction block, chronic
inﬂammatory
demyelinating
polyneuropathy,
infec-
tious neuropathy) or myopathies (e.g. inclusion body
myositis) should be ruled out. Flail arm ALS should
to be distinguished from mimics such as spinal muscu-
lar atrophy, Kennedy’s disease, multifocal motor neu-
ropathy and monomelic amyotrophy. In the case of
focal onset of neck extensor weakness, myasthenia
gravis and focal myopathy should be considered.
Muscle-speciﬁc tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia
can be accompanied by tongue weakness and atrophy
and be mistaken for bulbar ALS [68].
Investigations
The diagnosis of ALS relies on the medical history,
physical examination, electrodiagnostic testing (with
needle EMG) and neuroimaging. EMG remains a very
useful diagnostic tool to conﬁrm LMN involvement in
clinically aﬀected and non-aﬀected muscles (with ﬁb-
rillation potentials, sharp waves, fasciculation poten-
tials
in
relaxed
muscles
and
chronic
neurogenic
changes upon contraction) [8,69].
Biomarkers can play a crucial role in diagnostic,
prognostic or predictive research studies. They could
potentially
become
important
for
stratiﬁcation
of
patients and monitoring treatment eﬀects in clinical
trials. Although not yet integrated into standard clini-
cal practice, several biomarkers such as cerebrospinal
ﬂuid neuroﬁlament levels (especially phosphorylated
neuroﬁlament heavy subunit) are useful in supporting
the diagnosis [70–72], particularly in patients with
very recent onset of muscle weakness, without clear
signs of UMN involvement, or with concomitant neu-
ropathy/plexopathy/cervical myelopathy.

Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging
are often performed to exclude structural lesions
aﬀecting the motor system [73]. Furthermore, 18F-ﬂu-
orodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomog-
raphy, if readily available, can reveal a typical pattern
of hypometabolism in Rolandic brain regions and
frontotemporal involvement [74,75].
Genetic testing of the ﬁve most prevalent genes
found to be mutated in ALS is routinely oﬀered
to patients with a positive family history (C9orf72,
SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, TBK-1). Although there is
no consensus on genetic testing for patients with
sALS, there is a trend to oﬀer it to all patients
[76,77]. However, genetic testing should only be
performed if genetic counselling can be provided
in the event that a pathogenic gene mutation is
identiﬁed. Gene panels also including rarer ALS-
related genes are emerging, but the diagnostic yield
on top of the ﬁve most prevalently mutated genes
remains low.

ALS: A CLINICAL REVIEW
1925

Treatment/management
Over the last decades, more than 40 randomized con-
trolled trials in patients with ALS failed to show a
beneﬁcial eﬀect on disease progression or on survival,
illustrating the complexity of the disease [13]. In most
European
countries,
riluzole
remains
the
only
approved
disease-modifying
drug.
Riluzole
50 mg
twice daily has antiglutamatergic eﬀects and prolongs
the mean patient survival by 3–6 months [12,78,79].
The most common side eﬀects include nausea, diar-
rhoea, fatigue, dizziness and liver problems.
More recently, the free radical scavenger edaravone
has been studied in ALS. A phase III randomized
double-blind study of intravenous edaravone 60 mg/
day for 2 weeks per month in selected ALS patients
showed a signiﬁcantly smaller decline of the scores on
the ALSFRS-R after 6 months of treatment [80]. The
study has been criticized because of the small study
size, the short study duration, the selection of patients
and the lack of data on survival [81]. To date, edar-
avone has been approved for the treatment of ALS in
the USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Switzer-
land, but not in the European Union.
Another therapy under investigation is masitinib,
an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A randomized con-
trolled trial using 4.5 mg/kg/day of masitinib as an
add-on therapy to riluzole suggested a positive eﬀect
on the decline of ALSFRS-R, at least in patients with
a typical disease progression [82], an eﬀect that will be
further explored in a conﬁrmatory study.
The cornerstone of disease management for ALS
patients remains multidisciplinary care which has a
positive eﬀect on patient satisfaction and outcome [83].
Several discomforting symptoms of ALS can be man-
aged by symptomatic treatment options, including
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interven-
tions [83]. For instance, spasticity can be treated with
baclofen, tizanidine, cannabinoids and muscle stretch-
ing, and sialorrhea can be treated with anticholinergic
medications (amitriptyline, glycopyrronium bromide
and oxybutynin) and botulin toxin injections into the
salivatory glands. Muscle cramps may respond to mag-
nesium supplements, quinine sulfate, gabapentin or car-
bamazepine. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
amitriptyline, benzodiazepines and dextromethorphan
hydrobromide/quinidine sulfate, can be used in the case
of emotional lability. Dietary changes can help to
improve nutrition and a gastrostomy tube is an option
if the caloric intake is insuﬃcient or when swallowing
becomes hazardous. Speech therapy is frequently neces-
sary and assisted communication (customized software)
can also be used. Non-invasive ventilation is the pre-
ferred
life-prolonging
treatment
for
respiratory
insuﬃciency. At all disease stages, the patient’s individ-
ual wishes should be taken into account and advance
care planning should be initiated early.
Future prospects
Over the last years, the ﬁrst steps in the direction of a
precision
medicine
approach
for
ALS
have
been
taken. For several genetic subtypes of ALS, therapies
that target the upstream genetic cause are being devel-
oped. One of these therapeutic approaches uses anti-
sense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which are short single-
stranded nucleotide sequences that bind pre-mRNA
and mRNA to modulate gene expression or to alter
splicing. ASOs have been used successfully in several
pre-clinical models of ALS caused by SOD1 muta-
tions and C9orf72 repeat expansions [84,85]. Clinical
studies with intrathecal administration of ASOs tar-
geted against SOD1 and C9orf72 are currently ongo-
ing and the results are anxiously awaited. Stem cell
treatments, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating
factor-induced peripheral blood stem cells, bone mar-
row mesenchymal stem cells, non-neural progenitor
cells have been proved to be safe and well tolerated;
however, the eﬀects on disease progression are not yet
known. Several phase II and III clinical trials are
ongoing [86–88]. Overall, there is hope that a better
categorization of cases based on pathogenic mecha-
nisms will allow for targeted therapies with beneﬁcial
eﬀects in selected ALS subgroups and that ALS will
become a treatable condition in the future.
