Abstract
We have performed a systematic review to summarize current knowledge concerning factors
related to survival in ALS and to evaluate the implications of these data for clinical trials design.
The median survival time from onset to death ranges from 20 to 48 months, but 10–20% of ALS
patients have a survival longer than 10 years. Older age and bulbar onset are consistently reported
to have a worse outcome. There are conflicting data on gender, diagnostic delay and El Escorial
criteria. The rate of symptom progression was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor.
Psychosocial factors, FTD, nutritional status, and respiratory function are also related to ALS
outcome. The effect of enteral nutrition on survival is still unclear, while NIPPV has been found to
improve survival. There are no well established biological markers of progression, although some
are likely to emerge in the near future. These findings have relevant implications for the design of
future trials. Randomization, besides the type of onset, should take into account age, respiratory
status at entry, and a measure of disease progression pre-entry. Alternative trial designs can
include the use of natural history controls, the so-called minimization method for treatment
allocation, and the futility approach.
Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a
progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leading to limb paralysis,
dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory failure. The cause of the disease is unknown and there
is no effective cure. Although it is generally reported that the mean survival of patients from
symptom onset is 3–5 years (1), ALS has a considerable variability in outcome and its
prognostic factors are not satisfactorily defined. A better understanding of factors
influencing ALS outcome would guide physicians and patients in scheduling therapeutic
interventions (2) and is particularly relevant to clinical trials design (3).
The design of clinical trials to test compounds for therapeutic benefit in ALS relies on
accurate information on disease outcome and prognostic factors (4). A priori knowledge of
pattern of survival would allow effective stratification, decrease the number of patients that

need to be enrolled to achieve adequate study power, and, consequently, decrease the cost of
ALS trials. Unequal distribution of patients with different outcomes between the treatment
groups has complicated the interpretation of the results of at least three trials (branch chain
amino acids, IGF-1) (5-7). These failures indicate that the current method of case
stratification (i.e. bulbar onset versus spinal onset) may be inadequate. Another more subtle
bias in clinical trials is the inclusion of long-surviving (i.e. prevalent) patients.
The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge concerning factors related to
survival in ALS, to evaluate the strength of evidence supporting each factor, and to assess
the implications of these data for clinical trial design.
Methodological considerations
Search strategy and selection criteria
Papers published between 1960 and August 2008 were identified by PubMed literature
searches using the terms “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, “motor neuron disease”,
“progressive muscular atrophy”, “progressive bulbar palsy”, “survival”, “outcome”,
“prognosis”, and “prognostic factor”, Additional publications were identified using the
world wide web, from the references of these papers and from the authors’ own files. Only
articles in English were considered.
Classification of outcome studies
Outcome studies can be classified into three broad categories: 1) studies based on series
from ALS referral (tertiary) centres; 2) studies based on the placebo arm of pharmacological
trials; and 3) studies based on epidemiological series. Moreover, each study can be defined
as prospective or retrospective, according to the type of observation over time.
(1) Studies based on referral centres series (Table I) are typically based on large cohorts of
patients, collect high quality data on clinical factors, and have a high level of diagnostic
accuracy. However, referral centre studies are prone to patient selection bias due to the
retrospective nature of these studies, referral bias that is inherent to a tertiary referral centre,
and a relatively high loss to follow-up (8-15).
(2) Studies based on the placebo arm of pharmacological trials (5,16) (Table I) are generally
prospective, well conducted, and have a good standardization of examined prognostic
factors, a high level of diagnostic accuracy and include a relatively homogeneous
population. However, this population is likely to have unique characteristics, representing a
highly selected group of ALS patients, generally younger and more motivated than the
general ALS population (1,17), fulfilling the criteria for ‘probable’ and ‘definite’ ALS by
the El Escorial criteria (18) and with minimal respiratory involvement. Trial protocols
typically exclude patients with conditions such as renal or liver failure and a variety of other
chronic conditions, as well as fast progressors, thus further limiting the usefulness of these
data for prognostic purposes in the clinical setting.
(3) Prognostic surveys performed on population-based series rely on unselected populations,
and therefore are likely to provide a better assessment of prognostic factors. However, the
majority of epidemiologically-based studies are retrospective and small in size (19-22)
(Table II). Retrospective design has several pitfalls: 1) it does not allow certain prognostic
factors, such as symptoms progression rate to be assessed; 2) it is less accurate with regard
to certainty of disease diagnosis, since it is usually based on the retrospective revision of
clinical data; and 3) there is a risk of missing specific subsets of patients not captured by the
study design.

Recently, outcome studies based on prospective population-based registers using multiple
sources of information to ensure complete case ascertainment within a defined geographical
area have been published (23-27) (Table III). These studies represent an advancement of the
classical epidemiological studies and are considered the best available methodological
design for the study of rare disorders. They have the advantage of allowing the application
of uniform and definite diagnostic criteria and permit the assessment of prognostic factors in
a standardized manner. Most importantly, the completeness of case ascertainment permits
the analysis of the full clinical spectrum of the ALS population, in particular the old or very
old cases, as demonstrated by the older mean age of onset observed in the registry cohorts
compared to that of both retrospective epidemiological series and referral series. The
drawbacks of epidemiological registries are the costs of a prospective follow-up and the
complexity in organization and coordination.
Overall survival
The median survival from onset to death in ALS is reported to vary from 20 to 48 months
with ALS referral centres reporting longer survival times (8,9,11,13,28,29). This wide range
narrows when considering population-based studies, which are more likely to reflect the
experience of the general ALS population (20–36 months) (22-27). All studies report that 5
to 10% of ALS patients survive for more than 10 years.
Specific prognostic factors
Demographic factors
Age: The vast majority of studies has found that age is a strong prognostic factor in ALS,
with decreasing survival time correlating with increasing age of symptom onset
(9,11,12,14,20,25-27,31,32). Patients with symptom onset before 40 years of age have
longer survival, often exceeding 10 years (14,26). It is noteworthy that over 80% of patients
less than 40 years of age are men (26). Conversely, median survival among patients
presenting after 80 years of age is less than two years (31) and males and females are
equally represented in this age group.
Gender: Most studies have found that gender has no effect on ALS outcome, despite the
higher frequency of bulbar onset disease among older women. Notable exceptions are the
two register-based studies from Washington State, U.S.A. and Scotland (23,26) and the two
small retrospective studies (33,34) that found a significantly shorter survival among women
both in univariate and in multivariate analyses.
Clinical factors
Site of onset: Bulbar onset disease is associated with a worse prognosis than spinal onset
(12,14,26,32,35). This finding is not completely explained by the increased frequency of
bulbar disease in old age (17,24,25,31,35). In a registry-based study, the presence of bulbar
symptoms at the time of diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor (25) indicating that
bulbar function at any stage of the illness plays a major role in determining outcome.
Not surprisingly, respiratory onset disease is a strikingly negative prognostic factor (36,37).
However, a recent paper indicated that ALS patients with respiratory onset who underwent
non-invasive ventilation had a significant improvement of survival compared to those who
did not use non-invasive ventilation (38).
Data on differences in prognosis between patients with upper and those with lower limb
onset are conflicting. Some studies showed a poorer prognosis with lower limb onset
(11,25,32), perhaps due to an increased risk of thromboembolic disease and infections
Chio et al.

arising from loss of motility. One study found a poorer outcome in patients with upper limb
onset (39).
Patients with incomplete forms of motor neuron disease, such as those with pure lower
motor neuron disease (sometimes referred as progressive muscular atrophy, PMA), have a
better prognosis than those with ‘classic’ ALS (27,32).
Diagnostic delay: Several studies, but not all, have found that a longer delay from symptom
onset to diagnosis carries a better prognosis (10,12,14,15,26,27,29,35,40-42). Interestingly,
in a study comparing a population-based incidence cohort to a referral cohort, the duration
of symptoms from onset to diagnosis was significantly related to survival only in the latter
cohort (17). In general, the finding of a worse prognosis in patients with a short time delay
between onset and diagnosis is likely to indicate a more aggressive disease, which leads the
patient to seek medical attention more rapidly and is more readily diagnosed (26).
Family history of ALS: Most studies have not found any differences in outcome between
patients with sporadic and those with familial ALS (12,25,43). However, it is now generally
accepted that different mutations of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have different
effects on the age of onset of symptoms (43,44) and on the rate of progression of the disease.
For example, A4V mutation is associated with an extremely rapid decline, with a mean
survival of 12 months, whereas E21G, G37R, D90A G93C, and I113T mutations determine
a more benign course, with a median survival – 80 months) (43,45). In most instances,
clinically mild mutations are characterized by a prevalent lower motor neuron disease, with
few or no pyramidal signs. Furthermore, some mutations, such as I113T, are characterized
by large intra-familial variations both in age of onset and in clinical phenotype (46),
indicating the presence of modifying factors that may either be genetic or environmental in
nature. A systematic analysis of the different phenotypes of SOD1 mutations is still lacking.
Rate of disease progression: It has long been believed that the loss of motor neurons in
ALS is linear, but it is unclear if clinical decline is also linear. The rate of symptom
progression has been analysed in relatively few studies. A study analysing a series of 62
patients enrolled in two clinical trials found that linear estimates of rates of disease
progression based on isometric myometry and FVC measures were better predictors of
patient survival than demographic data (28). These findings were replicated in two
additional independent series (47). Similarly, in a prospective study based on a referral
centre, ALS outcome was significantly related to the decline of various measures of disease
progression (MRC compound score, FVC% and ALSFRS) during the first year of follow-up
(39). In a prospective register-based study, the rates of progression of respiratory, lower
limb and bulbar impairment during the first six months after diagnosis (measured with FVC,
MRC scale and bulbar scale, respectively) were independent prognostic factors in the Cox
multivariable model (25). Similar data were found from the analysis of two different series
of patients enrolled in the placebo arm of two clinical trials (16,48). In a recent paper on a
small series, the progression rate of ALSFRS-R score evaluated at presentation was
significantly related to ALS prognosis (49). Lastly, in a paper on a referral ALS series, the
rate of progression of ALS-FRS-R, both during the whole disease and the first 100 days
after diagnosis, revealed to be strongly related to survival (50).
Also, neurophysiological data support this concept: a study on the decline of motor unit
number using MUNE indicated that this parameter is related to prognosis (51). More
indirect evidence comes from the parallel decline between ALS-FRS and neurophysiological
measurements (52).

These observations, taken together, indicate that each individual ALS patient has an intrinsic
‘disease progression rate’, and that this rate is maintained during the course of the disease,
indirectly confirming the hypothesis of a linear decline of clinical status in ALS. More
important, these findings suggest that it could be possible to utilize symptom progression
rate as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials of new drugs.
Psychosocial factors—Although often overlooked by clinicians, psychosocial factors
seem to play an important role in ALS outcome. A longitudinal study has found that patients
with psychological distress (measured with a battery of psychological assessment scales
evaluating perceived stress, depression, hopelessness, anger expression, and purpose in life)
had a 2.24-fold (95% CI 1.08–4.64) increased risk of dying than patients with psychological
well-being (53). A longitudinal assessment of mood and self-esteem on survival showed that
lower mood predicted a faster progression and a shorter survival (54). However, it is also
possible that this effect is related to the fact that low mood is the consequence of having a
more rapidly progressive disease. In an analysis of the effect of quality of life (QoL) on
outcome, the physical health summary measure of the SF-36 was found to be independently
related to outcome, whereas only a trend was found for the mental health summary measure
(26). In the same paper, marital status was also shown to be relevant in the outcome of ALS;
patients who lived alone had a significantly worse prognosis than patients who were
married.
Despite this, attention must be drawn to one major caveat. There are increasing clinical,
pathological and genetic data suggesting that ALS and FTD syndromes form a spectrum of
disease (55). It is well recognized that ALS patients with florid FTD have a shortened
survival and so it cannot be discounted that the psychological features identified in the
above studies are symptomatic of early or mild clinical cognitive impairment (56). It should
be noted that none of the studies on QoL and survival rigorously assessed frontal lobe
function.
Cognitive functions: In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that 5–10% of ALS
patients develop an overt frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), and probably up to half of
all patients have a subtle impairment of temporal and frontal lobe cognitive function (57).
Despite this, there have been no population-based, longitudinal studies of cognition in ALS.
A recent clinic-based study found that patients with ALS-FTLD have a shorter survival than
those with normal executive and behavioural function (median survival, 28 months vs. 39
months) (51). This difference is likely to be due, at least in part, to poor compliance of ALS-
FTLD patients for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Conversely, mild cognitive impairment may have little or no
effect on ALS outcome (58).
Nutritional status: It is generally recognized that malnourishment is a relevant determinant
of outcome in ALS. However, surprisingly few studies, if any, have analysed this factor in
ALS series. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a generally accepted marker of nutritional status: in
a study on 55 ALS patients prospectively followed up, a BMI value 518.5 has been found to
be an independent prognostic factor for death both in univariate and in multivariable
analysis (59). Similarly, in a prospective study based on patients allocated to the placebo
arm of the CNTF trial, weight loss compared to pre-study weight appeared to be
significantly related to a worse prognosis (16).
Respiratory status: Respiratory function is generally considered important in ALS. All
studies evaluating respiratory status found that a lower predicted forced vital capacity (FVC
%) at diagnosis was the single most relevant prognostic factor in ALS (16,25,38,60,61). Per
cent predicted vital capacity (VC%) and the slope of decline of VC% have been

significantly correlated with ALS survival (62). Sniff nasal pressure (SNP) has been found
to accurately reflect intra-thoracic pressures and to be more significantly associated with
respiratory failure than FVC%, but not in bulbar onset patients (63). Upright and supine
forced vital capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure
(MEP) were significantly correlated to tracheostomy-free survival in a series of 95 ALS
patients (64).
Functional/disability scores: Several disability scores have been proposed for ALS. The
ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS) is the most widely used functional scale for ALS. A
recent single-centre study found that ALSFRS-R, a revised form of the original ALSFRS
score, was significantly related to outcome, and that the respiratory sub-score was the single
most significant component (41). In a small study, the progression rate of the ALSFRS-R,
calculated as differential of score from onset to diagnosis/disease duration (in months),
resulted to be significantly related to prognosis (49).
Rarely, other disability scores have been used for assessing ALS progression. In one centre
study, the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis score was the only significant prognostic factor
besides age (65). Similarly, the Appel ALS Score (AALSS) was a significant predictor of
ALS prognosis in a Cox multivariable analysis of a series of 831 patients from a tertiary
ALS centre (10). This finding was confirmed by a second study performed in the same ALS
centre, which found that both a higher baseline AALSS and a higher slope of AALSS from
onset to the basal visit were correlated to a shorter survival (29).
El Escorial criteria: The El Escorial criteria (EEC) (66) and their more recent revised form
(EEC-R) (18) were developed to provide a structured tool to define the level of confidence
of a diagnosis of ALS in individual patients in order to facilitate international collaboration
in clinical trials and studies of ALS. According to the presence of lower and upper motor
neuron signs and their distribution in four regions, i.e. bulbar, upper limb, thoracic, lower
limb, the EEC-R classify patients to different degrees of diagnostic certainty (definite,
probable, probable with laboratory confirmation, possible). Although mainly intended for
use in research settings, the EEC have also been studied as potential prognostic markers.
Most studies (13,15,25,27,39,41,67) but not all (24), have found that a diagnosis of definite
ALS at the time of presentation carries a poorer prognosis compared to all other diagnostic
levels. However, further analysis of the Irish data confirms that definite ALS carries a
significantly worse prognosis than suspected and possible ALS (unpublished data, Orla
Hardiman). Since a diagnosis of definite ALS implies muscle weakness and wasting in at
least three regions, this finding is likely to indicate that patients with more widespread
clinical involvement at the time of diagnosis have a more rapid progression of the disorder.
However, it must be noted that the EEC were not originally designed as tools to determine
burden of disease, but rather to reflect certainty of diagnosis, and in this context it is perhaps
not surprising that the specificity of the criteria as a prognostic indicator is poor.
Therapeutic factors
Therapeutic interventions: After the licensing of riluzole in 1996, several studies, both
population-based and from referral centres, have found a positive, independent, effect of this
drug on ALS patients outcome (13,25,68,69). Riluzole may improve mortality rate by 23%
and 15% at 6 and 12 months, respectively (68,70).
While the insertion of PEG is now widely used as a measure for avoiding starvation and
dehydration and improving QoL (71,72), it is still debated whether enteral nutrition has a
positive effect on survival. A population-based study has found that PEG is an independent
prognostic factor (25). Conversely, one study from Scotland found that PEG did not confer
Chio et al.

$watermark-text
$watermark-text
$watermark-text

any survival advantage compared to no gastrostomy (73), but this study reported a 25% one-
month mortality after gastrostomy, a figure substantially higher than that found in clinical
series (74). Also, different practices in proposing and executing PEG (i.e. early or late after
the onset of swallowing difficulties) could play a role.
Although two controlled studies have demonstrated that NIPPV confers a significant
advantage to ALS patients in terms of median survival (increase of 205 days) and quality of
life (35,75), surprisingly NIPPV has not been widely studied as a prognostic factor. In a
population-based study NIPPV did not modify overall survival, but this finding was
explained by the low number of patients who underwent this intervention (25). There are
indications that early NIPPV increases survival compared to late NIPPV (76).
Interdisciplinary care: A positive effect of being followed by a neurologist versus a non-
neurologist has been reported by two population-based studies (20,31). Recently, two
registry studies have shown that patients followed by ALS tertiary centres have a better
prognosis than patients seen by traditional neurology clinics (77,78), but this finding has not
been confirmed by another registry study (79). The positive effect of ALS centres seems to
be independent from all other considered prognostic factors (namely age, site of onset,
enteral nutrition and NIPPV), and has been therefore explained as a consequence of
comprehensive care of patients. However, these results should be considered cautiously,
since they were not controlled and were based on a post hoc analysis.
Biological markers
Biological markers of progression: One of the most difficult tasks in ALS is to identify
biological markers of disease progression. Contrasting results have been reported for APOE
genotypes, with most studies indicating no effect on survival (38,80,81), and a single study
on 403 ALS patients demonstrating that APOE plasma levels over 6.3 mg/dl were correlated
with a shorter survival time (Cox model, relative risk 1.083, 95% CI 1.019–1.151) (81) The
presence of a homozygous deletion SMN2 gene has been found to be over-represented in a
series of 110 ALS patients compared with controls (16% vs. 4%) and to carry a shorter
median survival time (2.3 vs. 4.2 years) (82); however, this finding was not confirmed by a
study on 106 patients with sporadic ALS and 18 with familial ALS (83). Recently, the
muscle expression of NOGO A, a protein inhibiting axonal regeneration, has been found to
significantly correlate with the severity of clinical disability of a series of 15 ALS patients
(84). A lower serum chloride level at study entry has been related to a worse prognosis in a
study based on 245 patients of the placebo group of the observational study on 2069
patients, plasma creatinine levels below the normal range resulted to be a strong independent
prognostic factor (15), although no convincing explanations for this finding have been
proposed. A recent study on 369 ALS patients from a single referral centre found a
significant increase of survival among patients with an elevated LDL/HDL ratio (85).
Although intriguing, this factor needs confirmation in different populations. A study of
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of brain in a small prospective series of
patients with ALS showed that patients with a Nacetylaspartate (NAA)/choline (Cho) ratio
in the motor cortex lower than 2.11 had a reduced survival of 19.4 months compared with
31.9 of patients with a ratio over 2.11 (86). According to the authors, this observation is
suggestive of cerebral degeneration and could represent a sensitive and specific marker both
of ALS diagnosis and ALS survival.
Summary of observations: The discrepancies about ALS survival found in the published
literature are mostly related to differences in study design. However, when considering only
studies based on register methodology (more likely to report the full spectrum of the ALS
population), the range of median survival is quite narrow (around 30 months from first

symptom). Interestingly, these studies are also characterized by an older age of onset (62–67
years) than those based on other designs. However, in 10–20% of cases survival exceeds
five years and, in 5–10%, 10 years.
Despite the evidence of several publications, it is still impossible to predict with a good
approximation the prognosis for an individual patient at the time of his/her diagnosis.
However, several prognostic factors are well established.
There is a general consensus that older age and bulbar onset are negatively related to ALS
outcome, but the complex relationship between age, female gender and bulbar onset remains
to be clarified. Also, the time delay from onset to diagnosis and the El Escorial diagnosis of
definite ALS at the time of presentation, seem to have prognostic relevance, since they
probably reflect a more rapid progression of the disorder.
Several measures of disease progression have been found to be related to ALS outcome; all
these measures have demonstrated linear progression, confirming the hypothesis that the
loss of function in ALS has a linear course, paralleling the rate of loss of motor neurons. It
remains to be established which is the best measure for estimating the loss of function in
ALS, but some studies reported that ALSFRS (or its more recent revision, ALSFRS-R)
could be a reliable, easy-to-use and reproducible measure to be included in trials. Several
trials are actually using these measures.
Although relatively few studies have been performed on psychosocial factors, these factors
seem to have a profound effect on ALS outcome, both influencing the patients’ choices on
the use of life-supporting interventions, such as PEG and NIPPV (2), and acting on their
health behaviour, on the behaviours of family and professional carers and on psychological
mechanisms relevant to disease progression (54). Also, the impairment of cognitive
functions could have some impact on ALS outcome, but this issue deserves further study
with standardized batteries of tests and a clearer definition of the level of cognitive
impairment to be included as a cut-point.
Advances in the care of people with ALS, including enteral nutrition and NIPPV, have to
some extent modified the course of the disease to the point that it is now no more possible to
talk of ‘ALS natural history’. These interventions should be considered when planning
future pharmacological trials. Even if only few studies have analysed it, multidisciplinary
care seems to have a positive and cost-effective effect on ALS outcome, and, most
important, this effect seems to be independent of other known prognostic factors. However,
the nature of this additional value of multidisciplinary centres remains unclear, and should
be further studied.
Today, despite some attractive preliminary findings, we still lack biological markers of ALS
progression that can be applied to routine clinical practice and clinical trials. It is likely,
however, that future search in this area will give us relevant new prognostic tools.
Implication for clinical trials: Use of El Escorial classification for the enrolment of
patients for clinical trials.
In all recent trials, only patients with clinically definite, clinically probable or clinically
probable-laboratory supported ALS were eligible for enrolment. However, it has been found
that 20–44% of ALS patients are trial ineligible (i.e. they have a clinically possible or
suspected ALS) at the time of diagnosis, and 5–10% of patients are still trial ineligible at
death (24,87). Moreover, the median time from symptom onset to trial eligibility has been
estimated to be 12.9 months (24). This observation questions the use of El Escorial
Chio et al.

classification as criteria for trial eligibility, and indicates the need to revise some aspects of
this classification.
Patient stratification for placebo-controlled trials: The traditional stratification for
clinical trials of ALS patients in bulbar and spinal onset is no longer sufficient and adequate.
The factors to be included in stratification should also include age, respiratory status at
entry, and a measure of disease progression pre-entry, such as the decline of ALSFRS-R
score in a 3–6 month run-in period before recruitment. Moreover, recognizing the effect of
PEG and NIPPV on ALS outcome, trial protocols should include guidelines for major
interventions and ‘best clinical practice’ for ALS patients. It is clear that such requirements
for the implementation of a clinical trial in ALS can be obtained only in medium-to-large
size phase III studies. Another proposed approach is the use of a lead-in period in order to
select a more homogeneous group of patients with a rapidly progressive disorder (88).
Alternative methods for designing smaller phase II clinical trials should therefore be
considered.
Alternative trial designs: Since the use of placebo in such a severe disorder as ALS may be
considered unethical, natural history controls have been advocated as an effective means to
eliminate placebo in clinical trials in ALS (10,15,48,89). This approach may also reduce the
number of patients that need to be recruited. The use of historical controls is quite frequent
in oncology, where knowledge of prognostic factors derived from well-designed natural
history studies allows accurate matching of cases and historical controls. However,
regulatory agencies currently do not accept non-controlled trials for the purpose of
registration of new drugs. Thus, clinical trials utilizing natural history controls are
appropriate only for phase I and II clinical trials.
An alternative approach to classical randomization, widely accepted in oncology for the
implementation of small trials, is minimization, a method ensuring excellent balance
between groups for a range of prognostic factors (90). With minimization, the treatment
allocated to the next participant enrolled in the trial depends on the characteristics of those
participants already enrolled. However, a requirement of this method is to establish ‘a priori’
all relevant prognostic factors and their respective weight (91).
A different option for phase II trials could be the futility approach, i.e. designing studies to
identify which agents are least likely to demonstrate benefits rather than the more typical
goal of identifying the most promising agents. In this approach the null hypothesis is that
treatment has promise and will therefore produce results exceeding a meaningful threshold
(93). This approach considerably reduces the sample size, with a reduction of costs, and,
more importantly, makes it possible to perform a large number of trials each with a reduced
number of centres. Such a design is being implemented in a study on coenzyme Q10 in ALS
(85). Again, however, the design of such studies should rely on the availability of hard
endpoints. Therefore, the complete understanding of more relevant factors related to ALS
outcome, including therapeutic interventions, remains a major goal of clinical research.
