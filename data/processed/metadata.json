Older age and bulbar onset are consistently reported to have a worse outcome. There are conflicting data on gender, diagnostic delay and El Escorial criteria. The rate of symptom progression was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor. Psychosocial factors, FTD, nutritional status, and respiratory function are also related to ALS outcome. The effect of enteral nutrition on survival is still unclear, while NIPPV has been found to improve survival. There are no well established biological markers of progression, although some are likely to emerge in the near future. These findings have relevant implications for the design of future trials.

The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no effective cure. Although it is generally reported that the mean survival of patients from symptom onset is 3\u20135 years (1), ALS has a considerable variability in outcome and its prognostic factors are not satisfactorily defined. A better understanding of factors influencing ALS outcome would guide physicians and patients in scheduling therapeutic interventions (2) and is particularly relevant to clinical trials design (3).

Only articles in English were considered. Classification of outcome studies Outcome studies can be classified into three broad categories: 1) studies based on series from ALS referral (tertiary) centres; 2) studies based on the placebo arm of pharmacological trials; and 3) studies based on epidemiological series. Moreover, each study can be defined as prospective or retrospective, according to the type of observation over time. (1) Studies based on referral centres series (Table I) are typically based on large cohorts of patients, collect high quality data on clinical factors, and have a high level of diagnostic accuracy. However, referral centre studies are prone to patient selection bias due to the retrospective nature of these studies, referral bias that is inherent to a tertiary referral centre, and a relatively high loss to follow-up (8-15). (2) Studies based on the placebo arm of pharmacological trials (5,16) (Table I) are generally prospective, well conducted, and have a good standardization of examined prognostic factors, a high level of diagnostic accuracy and include a relatively homogeneous population. However, this population is likely to have unique characteristics, representing a highly selected group of ALS patients, generally younger and more motivated than the general ALS population (1,17), fulfilling the criteria for \u2018probable\u2019 and \u2018definite\u2019 ALS by the El Escorial criteria (18) and with minimal respiratory involvement. Trial protocols typically exclude patients with conditions such as renal or liver failure and a variety of other chronic conditions, as well as fast progressors, thus further limiting the usefulness of these data for prognostic purposes in the clinical setting. (3) Prognostic surveys performed on population-based series rely on unselected populations, and therefore are likely to provide a better assessment of prognostic factors. However, the majority of epidemiologically-based studies are retrospective and small in size (19-22) (Table II). Retrospective design has several pitfalls: 1) it does not allow certain prognostic factors, such as symptoms progression rate to be assessed; 2) it is less accurate with regard to certainty of disease",

These studies represent an advancement of the classical epidemiological studies and are considered the best available methodological design for the study of rare disorders. They have the advantage of allowing the application of uniform and definite diagnostic criteria and permit the assessment of prognostic factors in a standardized manner. Most importantly, the completeness of case ascertainment permits the analysis of the full clinical spectrum of the ALS population, in particular the old or very old cases, as demonstrated by the older mean age of onset observed in the registry cohorts compared to that of both retrospective epidemiological series and referral series. The drawbacks of epidemiological registries are the costs of a prospective follow-up and the complexity in organization and coordination. Overall survival The median survival from onset to death in ALS is reported to vary from 20 to 48 months with ALS referral centres reporting longer survival times (8,9,11,13,28,29). This wide range narrows when considering population-based studies, which are more likely to reflect the experience of the general ALS population (20\u201336 months) (22-27). All studies report that 5 to 10% of ALS patients survive for more than 10 years. Specific prognostic factors Demographic factors Age: The vast majority of studies has found that age is a strong prognostic factor in ALS, with decreasing survival time correlating with increasing age of symptom onset (9,11,12,14,20,25-27,31,32). Patients with symptom onset before 40 years of age have longer survival, often exceeding 10 years (14,26). It is noteworthy that over 80% of patients less than 40 years of age are men (26). Conversely, median survival among patients presenting after 80 years of age is less than two years (31) and males and females are equally represented in this age group. Gender: Most studies have found that gender has no effect on ALS outcome, despite the higher frequency of bulbar onset disease among older women. Notable exceptions are the two register-based studies from Washington State, U.S.A. and Scotland (23,26) and the two small retrospective studies (33,34) that found a significantly shorter survival among women both in univariate and in multivariate analyses.",

However, it is now generally accepted that different mutations of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have different effects on the age of onset of symptoms (43,44) and on the rate of progression of the disease. For example, A4V mutation is associated with an extremely rapid decline, with a mean survival of 12 months, whereas E21G, G37R, D90A G93C, and I113T mutations determine a more benign course, with a median survival \u2013 80 months) (43,45). In most instances, clinically mild mutations are characterized by a prevalent lower motor neuron disease, with few or no pyramidal signs. Furthermore, some mutations, such as I113T, are characterized by large intra-familial variations both in age of onset and in clinical phenotype (46), indicating the presence of modifying factors that may either be genetic or environmental in nature.

More important, these findings suggest that it could be possible to utilize symptom progression rate as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials of new drugs. Psychosocial factors\u2014Although often overlooked by clinicians, psychosocial factors seem to play an important role in ALS outcome. A longitudinal study has found that patients with psychological distress (measured with a battery of psychological assessment scales evaluating perceived stress, depression, hopelessness, anger expression, and purpose in life) had a 2.24-fold (95% CI 1.08\u20134.64) increased risk of dying than patients with psychological well-being (53). A longitudinal assessment of mood and self-esteem on survival showed that lower mood predicted a faster progression and a shorter survival (54). However, it is also possible that this effect is related to the fact that low mood is the consequence of having a more rapidly progressive disease. In an analysis of the effect of quality of life (QoL) on outcome, the physical health summary measure of the SF-36 was found to be independently related to outcome, whereas only a trend was found for the mental health summary measure (26).

There are increasing clinical, pathological and genetic data suggesting that ALS and FTD syndromes form a spectrum of disease (55). It is well recognized that ALS patients with florid FTD have a shortened survival and so it cannot be discounted that the psychological features identified in the above studies are symptomatic of early or mild clinical cognitive impairment (56). It should be noted that none of the studies on QoL and survival rigorously assessed frontal lobe function. Cognitive functions: In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that 5\u201310% of ALS patients develop an overt frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), and probably up to half of all patients have a subtle impairment of temporal and frontal lobe cognitive function (57). Despite this, there have been no population-based, longitudinal studies of cognition in ALS. A recent clinic-based study found that patients with ALS-FTLD have a shorter survival than those with normal executive and behavioural function (median survival, 28 months vs. 39 months) (51). This difference is likely to be due, at least in part, to poor compliance of ALS- FTLD patients for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Conversely, mild cognitive impairment may have little or no effect on ALS outcome (58). Nutritional status: It is generally recognized that malnourishment is a relevant determinant of outcome in ALS. However, surprisingly few studies, if any, have analysed this factor in ALS series. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a generally accepted marker of nutritional status: in a study on 55 ALS patients prospectively followed up, a BMI value 518.5 has been found to be an independent prognostic factor for death both in univariate and in multivariable analysis (59).

Therapeutic factors Therapeutic interventions: After the licensing of riluzole in 1996, several studies, both population-based and from referral centres, have found a positive, independent, effect of this drug on ALS patients outcome (13,25,68,69). Riluzole may improve mortality rate by 23% and 15% at 6 and 12 months, respectively (68,70). While the insertion of PEG is now widely used as a measure for avoiding starvation and dehydration and improving QoL (71,72), it is still debated whether enteral nutrition has a positive effect on survival. A population-based study has found that PEG is an independent prognostic factor (25). Conversely, one study from Scotland found that PEG did not confer Chio et al. Page 6 Amyotroph Lateral Scler.

Although two controlled studies have demonstrated that NIPPV confers a significant advantage to ALS patients in terms of median survival (increase of 205 days) and quality of life (35,75), surprisingly NIPPV has not been widely studied as a prognostic factor. In a population-based study NIPPV did not modify overall survival, but this finding was explained by the low number of patients who underwent this intervention (25). There are indications that early NIPPV increases survival compared to late NIPPV (76).

Advances in the care of people with ALS, including enteral nutrition and NIPPV, have to some extent modified the course of the disease to the point that it is now no more possible to talk of \u2018ALS natural history\u2019. These interventions should be considered when planning future pharmacological trials. Even if only few studies have analysed it, multidisciplinary care seems to have a positive and cost-effective effect on ALS outcome, and, most important, this effect seems to be independent of other known prognostic factors.

It is clear that such requirements for the implementation of a clinical trial in ALS can be obtained only in medium-to-large size phase III studies. Another proposed approach is the use of a lead-in period in order to select a more homogeneous group of patients with a rapidly progressive disorder (88). Alternative methods for designing smaller phase II clinical trials should therefore be considered. Alternative trial designs: Since the use of placebo in such a severe disorder as ALS may be considered unethical, natural history controls have been advocated as an effective means to eliminate placebo in clinical trials in ALS (10,15,48,89). This approach may also reduce the number of patients that need to be recruited. The use of historical controls is quite frequent in oncology, where knowledge of prognostic factors derived from well-designed natural history studies allows accurate matching of cases and historical controls. However, regulatory agencies currently do not accept non-controlled trials for the purpose of registration of new drugs. Thus, clinical trials utilizing natural history controls are appropriate only for phase I and II clinical trials.

The main manifestations of upper motor neuron disease are muscle weakness, increased muscle tone and stiffness (spasticity), increased reflexes (hyperreflexia), and abnormal speech and swallowing [1]. In contrast, manifestations of lower motor neuron disease present as muscle wasting (atrophy) and twitching (fasciculations), loss of muscle tone (flaccid paralysis), and decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia).

To achieve therapeutic goals, strength training for muscles employing low-to-mild intensity and load, coupled with aerobic exercises, for example, stationary cycling, swimming, and walking, are some of the exercises frequently used to treat PALS. In the early and middle phases of ALS, strength training and aerobic exercises are considered more suitable for PALS. Moreover, it is crucial for physiotherapists to strike an equilibrium between underworking and overworking patients and to make accommodations according to their responses and other disease-related factors. PALS should be careful not to push themselves too much and to track any signs of overuse or fatigue in an exercise log that can be reviewed by their physical therapist.

PALS patients who display bulbar symptoms experience more severe swallowing complications, such as aspiration. Swallowing dysfunction occurs because of the inefficacy of oral movements, laryngeal elevation, pharyngeal contraction, and restriction of tongue base movements. Early and personalized nutritional care should be provided to PALS in their initial phase of disease due to the weight loss associated with bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia. The loss of body fat and lean mass relates to the decreased energy reserve in PALS. Jejunostomy, or gastrotomy, is an alternative way of feeding PALS. The benefit of gastrotomy is enhanced nutrition, as nutrients come directly to the stomach via this procedure.

Gradually, spasticity may develop in the weakened atrophic limbs, affecting manual dexterity and gait. Patients with bulbar onset ALS usually present with dysarthria and dysphagia for solids or liquids. Limb symptoms can develop almost simultaneously with bulbar symptoms, and in the vast majority of cases will occur within 1-2 years. Paralysis is progressive and leads to death due to respiratory failure within 2-3 years for bulbar onset cases and 3-5 years for limb onset ALS cases.",

Genetics is another contributing factor; heritability is higher in mother-daughter pairs [1], and the most common ALS risk gene, C9ORF72, results in an earlier onset in males compared to females [14]. Therefore, ALS development is driven by a complex interaction of age, sex, and genetic factors [15], which has significant implications for both preclinical and clinical research, as well as clinical trials. ALS incidence is influenced by ancestral background and biological sex, with vari- ations seen across different age groups [15]. Although the disease is more prevalent in males, heritability appears to be higher among females, particularly with the highest con- cordance observed in female\u2013female parent\u2013offspring pairs [1]. Additionally, males with the C9ORF72 repeat expansion typically experience the onset of ALS approximately two years earlier than females with the same genetic marker [14]. Thus, the risk of developing ALS is shaped by a complex interplay of age, sex, and genetic factors [15].

Various factors have been investigated to understand their impact on ALS risk, including smoking, physical activity, and exposure to metals, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields. Smoking has been consistently linked to an increased risk of ALS. However, the relationship between physical activity, particularly intense sports, and ALS remains unclear. Work-related exposure to metals such as lead and mercury has been proposed as a potential risk factor for ALS in several studies. Additionally, military service, especially during the Gulf War, has been associated with a higher incidence of ALS, possibly due to environmental exposures like high selenium levels from oil fires. Traumatic brain injuries and occupations involving electrical work have also been examined as risk factors, but the findings are mixed. These insights underscore the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors in the development of ALS [16,17]. 3.",

In mammalian cells, protein degradation occurs via two primary pathways: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy mechanisms. The UPS primarily degrades small, soluble proteins that are tagged for destruction, whereas autophagy handles the clearance of larger protein complexes. Although this suggests that enhancing autophagy might be an effective strategy for removing toxic TDP-43 aggregates, the formation and progression of these aggregates beyond protein monomers may point to an initial dysfunction in the UPS. Furthermore, TDP-43 inclusions are known to accumulate when both UPS and autophagy are inhibited [18\u201321]. Up to 10% of ALS patients have at least one other affected family member, classifying their condition as familial ALS (fALS), which is almost always inherited in an autosomal dominant manner [22]. Although over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes have been identified, the most frequent pathogenic variants occur in SOD1, C9ORF72, FUS, and TARDBP, with disease-causing variants in other genes being relatively uncommon [23]. The prevalence of ALS cases attributed to variants in these common ALS-linked genes varies between European and Asian populations.

An increase in rare variants, many of unknown significance, has been found in the untranslated regions of known disease- causing genes, including SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, VCP, OPTN, and UBQLN2, highlighting the potential importance of regulatory gene regions in determining disease pathogenesis and making genetic diagnoses [25]. Heritability can also be difficult to determine due to the incomplete penetrance of variants in many ALS-associated genes. For example, C9ORF72 and ATXN2 variants exhibit incomplete penetrance, with symptoms not always manifesting in mutation carriers [14,26]. This can cause inherited cases to appear sporadic. A substantial portion of the genetic risk for sALS remains unidentified; as a result, much research has focused on understanding how variations and differences in the expres- sion of known ALS-linked genes lead to the disease. The genes SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, and C9ORF72 have been the most extensively studied. In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s (AD-PD-HD), and ALS neuroinflammation has emerged as a crucial factor driving the progression of neuronal degeneration. Research has increasingly highlighted the significant role that chronic inflammation in the brain plays in exacerbating these conditions. Multiple studies have shown that cannabinoids possess properties that can effectively reduce this neuroinflammatory burden. These compounds, derived from the cannabis plant, Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 4 of 21 interact with the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which is involved in regulating inflammation and neuroprotection. By modulating immune responses and reducing inflam- matory cytokines, cannabinoids have demonstrated potential in mitigating the harmful effects of neuroinflammation. This growing body of evidence suggests that cannabinoid- based therapies could offer promising new avenues for treating neurodegenerative diseases by addressing one of their key underlying mechanisms [27]. 4. Protein Misfolding and Aggregation: Role of C9ORF72, TDP-43, SOD1, FUS 4.1. C9ORF72 The hexanucleotide repeat expansion is located in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene. The actual sizes of these repeats vary significantly among C9ORF72 patients. Although the threshold for pathogenic repeat size remains unknown, a cutoff of 30 repeats is commonly used in most studies. Healthy individuals typically have fewer than 11 repeats, while most patients exhibit several hundreds to thousands of repeats [28]. A small subset of patients also display shorter expansions ranging from 45 to 80 repeats [29]. The repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is a major genetic factor in ALS and FTD, accounting for approximately 40% of familial ALS (FALS), 30% of familial FTD (FFTD), and about 8% of sporadic ALS (SALS) cases, particularly in predominantly Caucasian populations.",

    "text": "The discovery of the C9ORF72 mutation in ALS and FTD has led scientists to explore its potential involvement in other neurodegenerative disorders as well [30]. Regarding cell type distribution, C9ORF72 expression is notably high in myeloid cells, particularly in CD14+ monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, while it is lower in lymphoid cells and other tissues. Overall, the C9ORF72 protein is mainly expressed in the brain, spinal cord, and immune system, with lower levels detected in other organs such as the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, reflecting the transcript\u2019s expression profile [31]. The C9ORF72 gene transcribes three distinct mRNA isoforms (V1\u2013V3), which encode two proteins: C9ORF72-long (C9-L), a 481-amino acid protein, and C9ORF72-short (C9-S), a truncated protein isoform of 222 amino acids [32]. The 481-amino acid C9-L isoform is the most abundant. In mouse tissues and the human brain, C9ORF72 is predominantly cytoplasmic, with punctate staining in neurites, indicative of synaptic terminals. C9ORF72 also plays a role in stress granule (SG) formation and degradation [33]. Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless ribonucleoproteins that contain mRNA and accumulate in the cytoplasm when translation initiation is halted, disappearing once stress is alleviated [34]. Upon stress-related stimuli, C9-L is recruited to SGs. In the absence of C9ORF72, these granules fail to form, and other SG-associated proteins like TIA-1, G3BP1, and HuR are downregulated. C9ORF72 is also crucial for cellular recovery post-stress, as it interacts with p62 to target SGs for autophagy-mediated degradation [35]. Moreover, C9-L interacts with SMCR8 through its DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain, and when the C9-L-SMCR8 complex associates with WDR41, it functions as a GTPase-activating protein potentially involved in membrane trafficking, including endolysosomal pathways and autophagy [36]. The loss of C9ORF72 in mice and motor neurons derived from iPSCs leads to synaptic plasticity alterations and defects in glutamate receptor homeostasis [37]. Recent studies have also implicated C9ORF72 in regulating neuronal nucleocytoplasmic transport by disrupting interactions between importin \u03b21 and nucleoporin [38]. According to a study conducted by Celona et al., the expansion of a six-nucleotide GGGGCC repeat in the first intron of the C9ORF72 gene is the most prevalent inherited cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These repeated sequences in RNA can aggregate within cells and are translated through a mech- anism called repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, producing dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins that are highly toxic. The study reveals that the zinc finger RNA-binding protein Zfp106 plays a critical role in counteracting these harmful effects.",

Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 5 of 21 shown to prevent the formation of RNA foci, substantially decrease RAN translation driven by GGGGCC repeats, and inhibit the accumulation of toxic DPRs in cells derived from C9ORF72 patients. Additionally, the study found that Zfp106 binds to RNA G-quadruplex structures, inducing a change in their conformation. This binding appears to be a key factor in Zfp106\u2019s ability to mitigate the cytotoxic effects associated with GGGGCC repeats, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for C9ORF72-linked ALS and FTD [39]. There is widespread agreement that the arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs), specif- ically glycine-arginine (GR) and proline-arginine (PR), exhibit the highest neurotoxicity across multiple model systems [40]. Due to the growing interest in these arginine-rich DPRs, there has been a greater focus on PR, GR, or both, compared to other DPRs. Conse- quently, several mechanisms have been associated with PR and GR expression, including nucleocytoplasmic transport [41,42], DNA damage [43,44], translational disruption [45], and stress granule dysfunction [46]. Drosophila models have been particularly valuable in elucidating these toxic mechanisms, which have subsequently been validated in mouse models, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and patient tissues. Recent advancements with fly models continue to prioritize research on repeat- associated non-AUG (RAN) translation and DPRs, given their role in C9orf72 hexanu- cleotide repeat expansions. Factors regulating RAN translation are under investigation, with a proposed mechanism of DPR-induced toxicity in C9orf72-associated neurodegenera- tion involving inhibited translation through interactions between ribosomal proteins and DPRs, specifically poly-GR and poly-PR. Emerging evidence indicates that the three primary hypotheses regarding DPR toxicity are not mutually exclusive. For example, one study demonstrated that reduced C9orf72 activity heightens susceptibility to degenerative stimuli, such as glutamate-induced excito- toxicity and impaired DPR clearance [47]. Essentially, haploinsufficiency intensifies toxic gain-of-function effects, a finding supported by studies showing that C9orf72 reduction suppresses autophagy, leading to DPR accumulation and neuronal death [48,49]. Research on autophagy in Drosophila C9orf72 models has shown that, in motor neu- rons, 30-repeat DPRs disrupt the morphology and dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), impairing autophagosome formation. Despite ER disruption in both axons and synapses, autophagosomes remained intact in axons, although their biogenesis was hin- dered at synaptic terminals [50]. Motor neurons can also be analyzed for synaptic dysfunction. A recent study using Drosophila C9orf72 revealed a novel cell-autonomous excitotoxicity mechanism selectively associated with arginine-rich DPRs in glutamatergic neurons. These DPRs\u2014poly-GR and poly-PR\u2014exhibited moderate toxicity at 36 repeats, increasing synaptic boutons, active zones, extracellular glutamate, intracellular calcium, and presynaptic NMDA receptor activation [51].",

These findings support the potential of glutamate inhibition therapies and underscore the need for further investigation into synaptic dysfunction in C9orf72-FTD pathology. 4.2. TDP-43 TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a vital RNA/DNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, and transport. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), TDP-43 is primarily associated with its pathological forms. In ALS, TDP-43 mislocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it forms insoluble and ubiquitinated inclusions. These pathological aggregates are a hallmark of both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The misfolding and aggregation of TDP-43 are driven by mutations in the TARDBP gene, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, and its tendency to form amyloid-like fibrils. This mislocalization disrupts RNA processing and cellular homeostasis, leading to neu- Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 6 of 21 ronal toxicity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TDP-43 pathology is crucial for developing targeted therapies for ALS [52,53]. A proposed model for TDP-43 toxicity utilizing Drosophila suggests that the cyto- plasmic accumulation of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) in adult flies is sufficient to induce degeneration. This finding aligns with other models of toxicity related to the mislocalization of ALS-associated genes. Additionally, the study observed that the knockdown of TBPH, the Drosophila homolog of TDP-43, did not produce any phenotypic changes, indicating that a toxic gain of function due to cytoplasmic TDP-43 may contribute to pathogenesis. However, this hypothesis remains uncertain, as a loss of nuclear TDP-43 function might also play a role in the development of the disease [54]. Another proposed model of toxicity in Drosophila involves mitochondrial dysfunction. In transgenic flies expressing human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) induced by heat shock through the Elav-Gal4 pan-neuronal driver, the mitochondria in the eye exhibited a marked reduction in size compared to controls. Additionally, 85% of the mitochondria in the photoreceptors of hTDP-43-expressing flies displayed swollen or vesicular cristae. This damage to the mitochondrial cristae mirrors that observed in the brain tissues of patients with hTDP- 43 proteinopathy, underscoring the utility of Drosophila as a model for studying this gene. Given that mitochondria are a known source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to ROS accumulation, negatively impacting neuronal survival and function.",

SOD1 The SOD1 gene (encoding superoxide dismutase 1 [Cu/Zn]) was the first to be linked to ALS in 1993 [56]. SOD1 encodes a metalloenzyme composed of 153 amino acids and is one of three superoxide dismutase enzymes in humans. This protein binds copper and zinc and forms a highly stable homodimer. SOD1 dimers are located in the cytosol and the intermembrane space of mitochondria, playing a crucial role in antioxidant defense by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals, produced during cellular respiration, into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [57]. Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is crucial in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the SOD1 gene are a primary genetic cause of familial ALS, accounting for approximately 20% of these cases. These mutations result in the misfolding and aggregation of the SOD1 protein, which is highly toxic to motor neurons. The toxic effects are believed to arise from a combination of factors, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of protein homeostasis. Mutant SOD1 proteins can form aggregates that interfere with cellular processes, disrupt mitochondrial function by localizing to the outer mitochondrial membrane, and induce apoptosis. Additionally, the presence of misfolded SOD1 has been shown to enhance the aggregation of other ALS- associated proteins, such as TDP-43, further amplifying the neurodegenerative process.

    "text": "[58]. Drosophila melanogaster models have been pivotal in elucidating the role of the SOD1 gene in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As the first gene linked to familial ALS (fALS), SOD1 encodes the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase-1. By leveraging genetic tools to express human SOD1 (hSOD1) and its ALS-associated mutations in specific Drosophila tissues, researchers have uncovered key insights into the disease\u2019s mechanisms. These models demonstrate that hSOD1 mutations can trigger both loss of function (LOF) and toxic gain of function (GOF) effects, leading to neurodegeneration characterized by motor dysfunction, reduced lifespan, and synaptic abnormalities. Notably, despite severe phenotypes such as developmental defects and impaired locomotion, these models often Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 7 of 21 lack significant neuronal death, differing from vertebrate observations. This highlights the complexity of SOD1-linked ALS and underscores the value of Drosophila in studying the disease\u2019s molecular and cellular underpinnings. Additionally, these models have been instrumental in screening potential therapeutic compounds, identifying agents that may alleviate the neurotoxic effects of mutant SOD1 [59]. Moreover, a study conducted by Liguori et al. (2024), utilizing Drosophila models expressing the human mutant SOD1 genes (A4V and G85R), demonstrated that these mutations lead to reduced survival and impaired motor performance, concurrently with the induction of early neuroinflammatory markers, such as the glial marker Repo, and the upregulation of immune pathways involving antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Moreover, the study shed light on the heightened oxidative stress and the presence of chromosome aberrations, indicating that genomic instability and altered cellular homeostasis represent some of the most important moments in the early stages of ALS pathogenesis. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that motor neuron degeneration is the primary initiating factor in ALS, instead emphasizing the possibility that early neuroinflammation and oxidative stress may precede and potentially precipitate the cascade of neuronal damage, thereby suggesting new opportunities for early therapeutic intervention [60]. Furthermore, a study conducted by Scaricamazza et al [61]. showed that endurance exercise in female mice can lead to the aggravation of the SOD1-G93A ALS onset since it induces a more oxidative phenotype in muscle fibers, exacerbating muscle denervation, and promoting motor neuron loss. Additionally, due to increased immune cell infiltration in the sciatic nerve, the progression of ALS is accelerated. Therefore, despite the fact that physical exercises are a healthy habit, endurance exercises represent risk factors when it comes to ALS [61]. 4.4.

FUS has several roles similar to TDP-43, including involvement in gene expression, transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA transport, and regulation of translation [64]. However, despite these similarities, TDP-43 and FUS target different RNAs and have unique sequence binding specificities [65]. As of now, researchers have identified more than 50 distinct variants of the FUS gene that are linked to autosomal dominant forms of ALS. The majority of these genetic alterations are missense mutations, which involve single amino acid changes. However, there have also been less common cases where insertions, deletions, splicing errors, or nonsense mutations have been observed in patients. These various mutations contribute to the diversity of genetic presentations seen in ALS associated with FUS gene anomalies [66]. Many pathogenic variants are located within the nuclear localization signal, leading to the mislocalization of FUS to the cytoplasm. Other mutations occur in regions rich in glycine and arginine, the prion-like domain, and the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) [67]. Some variants in these regions increase the likelihood of the protein forming solid aggregates, indicating multiple pathogenic mechanisms in FUS-related ALS [68]. RNA homeostasis, or \u201cribostasis\u201d, is as essential as proteostasis. Disruptions in RNA metabolism can cause toxicity in various ways, some of which are linked to proteostasis. As per the central dogma of molecular biology, RNA acts as the \u201cmessenger\u201d between DNA and the protein synthesis machinery, implicating RNA in the pathogenicity of protein misfolding diseases like ALS. However, RNA\u2019s lifecycle is complex, involving numerous regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that play crucial roles in RNA transport, post- transcriptional editing, translation, and degradation [69]. Furthermore, RNA and RBPs can form membraneless organelles called ribonuclear protein (RNP) granules, which are vital for RNA metabolism and gene regulation [70]. The functions of these RNP granules vary depending on the specific RNA and RBPs they contain. Recent studies have focused Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 8 of 21 on particular RNPs, such as stress granules and paraspeckles, both of which have been implicated in ALS pathogenesis. The role of stress granules, in particular, has been debated as a key factor in ALS-related aggregation.

RNA interference (RNAi) lines used to knock down caz gene expression in neurons showed that caz silencing did not impact lifespan but did impair climbing performance [79]. Knockdown of caz in the eye led to a rough eye phenotype resulting from apoptotic cells in the pupal retina; this phenotype could be rescued by the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein p35 [80]. The generation of new caz null mutants and conditional alleles using ho- mologous recombination confirmed the previously observed phenotypes of pupal lethality and locomotor defects [81]. These findings support the essential role of caz in neural devel- opment and provide evidence in favor of the loss-of-function (LOF) hypothesis to explain FUS-induced neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Gain-of-function (GOF) of caz resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed with FUS overexpression, including impaired larval locomotion, reduced synaptic bouton number, and severe eye degeneration [82]. Additionally, both caz and FUS GOF induced apoptosis when expressed in motorneurons [79]. These findings further support (i) the concept of evolutionary conservation between caz and FUS and (ii) the pivotal role of FUS expression levels in triggering the neurodegener- ative process [78,83,84].

Upper motor neuron (UMN) findings include hyperreflexia, poor dexterity, incoordination, and spasticity. Com- mon bulbar UMN findings are dysarthria and dysphagia. Lower motor neuron (LMN) findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations [85]. Weakness, a central feature, can result from dysfunction in either upper or lower motor neurons. The initial presentation influences the pattern of symptom progression and has prognostic significance. Most patients initially present with asymmetric LMN symptoms localized to the arm or leg [86]. Common early clinical signs include hand weakness, shoulder girdle weakness, and foot drop. Bulbar-onset ALS, which occurs in 25% of patients, typically presents with dysarthria and dysphagia. A minority of patients initially present with respiratory muscle weakness or generalized weakness combined with bulbar muscle weakness [87]. In patients who develop cognitive symptoms, impaired word fluency is an early finding. Other features of executive dysfunction, such as mental inflexibility, inattention, disinhibition, or difficulty in planning or problem-solving, can emerge as the disease progresses [88]. Impairment in multiple cognitive domains is less common in ALS and, when present, usually involves language or memory and may be confounded by co- pathologies such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [89]. Behavioral abnormalities are a frequent neuropsychiatric feature in ALS, with apathy being the most common. Other behavioral changes include disinhibition, perseverative behavior, altered food preferences, loss of empathy, and impaired social cognition, including emotional processing [90,91]. Pathological crying and laughing, also known as emotional lability or pseudobulbar affect, is present in approximately one-third of patients with ALS and is associated with gray and white matter pathology in the cortico-cerebellar network.

The development of the Awaji criteria, which stemmed from a revised algorithm for the clinical neurophysiological assessment in diagnosing ALS, formulated through a consensus among experts and grounded in the existing literature, has been criticized for potentially possessing several limitations [96]. The Awaji criteria proposed that neurophysiological indicators of lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction should be considered equivalent to clinical signs of LMN involve- ment, while the assessment of upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction remained reliant on clinical evaluation. Compared to the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC), the Awaji criteria demonstrated increased sensitivity in several studies [97,98]. However, some stud- ies reported lower sensitivities [99,100], a discrepancy attributed to the exclusion of the probable-laboratory-supported diagnostic category. Notably, the diagnostic advantage of the Awaji criteria was found to be most significant in cases of bulbar-onset ALS [96]. The use of the Awaji algorithm eliminates the somewhat artificial distinction between clinically definite ALS and EMG definite ALS, as it integrates the clinical and electrophysi- ological diagnostic processes, treating them as complementary rather than independent assessments [98].

The criteria specify that upper motor neuron dysfunction is characterized by at least one of the following: increased deep tendon reflexes, the presence of pathological reflexes (such as the Hoffman or Babinski signs), increased muscle tone (spasticity), or slowed and poorly coordinated voluntary movements not attributable to lower motor neuron weakness or Parkinsonian features. In contrast, lower motor neuron dysfunction requires either clinical evidence of muscle weakness and wasting or electromyography (EMG) abnormalities. These EMG findings must indicate chronic neurogenic changes, such as large motor unit potentials, and evidence of ongoing denervation, which may manifest as fibrillation potentials or positive sharp waves [102].

The absence of a definitive biological marker for ALS, the highly variable initial clinical presentations of the disease, and its pathogenic overlap with several neurodegenerative disorders all contribute to the difficulty in diagnosing ALS with acceptable certainty [103]. Moreover, we should also take into account the importance of ALS staging. Two of the most important staging systems are represented by MiTo and King\u2019s [104,105]. The King\u2019s Clinical Staging System and the Milano-Torino (MiToS) Functional Staging System represent two distinct approaches for assessing the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The King\u2019s staging system divides ALS into five stages, which are determined by the extent of clinical involvement and its impact on feeding or respiratory function. Stage 1 denotes the onset of symptoms, while Stage 5 corresponds to death. Although the King\u2019s staging is not directly derived from the ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R), there is a 92% concordance when estimating stages from ALSFRS-R scores. This system is primarily concerned with the anatomical spread of the disease and significant respiratory muscle involvement, providing greater specificity in distinguishing stages during the early to mid-phases of ALS. Conversely, the MiToS staging system comprises six stages, from 0 to 5, based on functional abilities as measured by the ALSFRS-R. Stage 0 reflects normal function, whereas Stage 5 represents death. The MiToS system is specifically designed to evaluate the func- tional capabilities affected by ALS, with a particular focus on the later stages of the disease due to its emphasis on the functional burden. While these two staging systems differ in their approaches, they are complementary rather than redundant, each offering unique perspectives on",

If only lower motor neuron (LMN) features are present, diagnoses like plexopathy, peripheral neuropathy (e.g., mul- tifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, infectious neuropathy), or myopathies (e.g., inclusion body myositis) should be ruled out.

It also noncompetitively inhibits AMPA and N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors on postsynaptic neurons. Finally, Riluzole appears to reduce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake and enhance GABA receptors [110].

One rationale is neuroprotective, suggesting that changes in muscle and neuromuscular junctions may contribute to retrograde degeneration, as indicated by recent research on the role of muscle-secreted toxic exosomes in motor neuron degeneration [117]. The second approach focuses on symptom relief by increasing muscle contractility. This includes the development of two troponin activators, tirasemtiv [118,119] and reldesemtiv (NCT04944784), aimed at enhancing muscle contractility. Additionally, there are efforts to improve muscle mass and strength [120]. For frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with the C9orf72 expansion, structural and functional MRI studies indicate that subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus, are more likely to be affected compared to sporadic cases. Patients with FTD resulting from GRN or TBK1 mutations have been reported to Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 9966 13 of 21 exhibit prominently asymmetric atrophy, which is most noticeable in the later stages of the disease. In comparison to sporadic ALS, C9orf72-associated ALS demonstrates more extensive frontotemporal involvement, even in the absence of cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Additionally, many SOD1 variants are linked to more pronounced cervical spinal cord atrophy, with a relative preservation of cortical motor networks [121]. 7. Emerging Therapies and Future Directions 7.1. Gene Therapy: Advances in Gene Editing and Antisense Oligonucleotides Gene therapy for ALS is a promising approach that targets genetic mutations in SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP, and FUS. Various strategies have been developed to address these genetic abnormalities, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA interference (RNAi) to degrade or inhibit abnormal mRNA, as well as gene delivery via viral vectors to replace defective genes. For example, ASOs targeting the SOD1 gene have shown effectiveness in reducing toxic protein levels in preclinical studies and have advanced to clinical trials.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer a valuable platform for studying ALS, providing insights into disease mechanisms across all genotypes and aiding in modeling sporadic cases. hiPSCs enable the development of high-throughput genetic and chemical screens [124]. Protocols for differentiating hiPSCs into astrocytes have been established for over a decade, while protocols for hiPSC-derived microglia have emerged more recently [125]. These protocols aim to mimic microglial development, distinct from blood macrophages, as microglia originate from yolk sac- derived progenitors [126,127]. Despite their potential, challenges remain in modeling ALS with hiPSCs. Simplified hiPSC-derived monocultures allow the study of cell-autonomous effects, but understanding non-cell-autonomous disease mechanisms requires modeling interactions between neurons and glia. Co-cultures of hiPSC-derived neurons and glia support glial maturation and have been used to study ALS patient-derived cells [128]. More complex in vitro models incorporating multiple cell types would be ideal. For example, ezogabine, a potassium channel activator, reduced neuronal excitability in SOD1 and C9ORF72 hiPSC models, leading to a phase 2 clinical trial that showed decreased motor neuron excitability [129]. Similarly, the src/c-Abl inhibitor bosutinib improved hiPSC-derived motor neuron survival and muscle contractions in ALS models and is currently in clinical trials.

Neurofilaments Neurofilaments are among the most widely characterized fluid biomarkers in neu- rodegenerative diseases. Found only in neurons, these intermediate, filamentous proteins form part of the cytoskeletal structure and are particularly abundant in myelinated ax- ons [131]. Released into the interstitial fluid during neuroaxonal injury and easily measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neurofilaments especially neurofilament light (NfL) and phos- phorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) have become markers of neuronal injury and degeneration. Consequently, neurofilaments in CSF have been extensively studied as diagnostic, prognostic, susceptibility/risk, and response biomarkers for ALS. Studies have shown that CSF and blood neurofilament levels are higher in ALS pa- tients compared to those with ALS mimics, indicating their usefulness in distinguishing between the two groups [132,133].

The loss of upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex, the brain stem nuclei and the anterior horn of the spinal cord gives rise to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. ALS often has a focal onset but subsequently spreads to di\ufb00erent body regions, where failure of res- piratory muscles typically limits survival to 2\u20135 years after disease onset. In up to 50% of cases, there are extra-motor manifestations such as changes in behaviour, executive dysfunction and language problems. In 10%\u201315% of patients, these problems are severe enough to meet the clinical criteria of fron- totemporal dementia (FTD). In 10% of ALS patients, the family history sug- gests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The remaining 90% have no a\ufb00ected family members and are classi\ufb01ed as sporadic ALS. The causes of ALS appear to be heterogeneous and are only partially understood. To date, more than 20 genes have been associated with ALS. The most common genetic cause is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, responsible for 30%\u201350% of familial ALS and 7% of sporadic ALS. These expansions are also a frequent cause of frontotemporal dementia, emphasizing the molecular overlap between ALS and FTD.",

FTD is characterized by the degeneration of frontal and anterior temporal lobes and presents clinically by behavioural changes, impair- ment of executive functioning and/or language impair- ment [5]. ALS and FTD are now considered to be two ends of a spectrum due to the overlap in molecu- lar mechanisms underlying both neurodegenerative disorders [6]. At the genetic level there is considerable disease heterogeneity as well, with more than 20 genes that have been associated with ALS. The \ufb01ve most com- mon genetic causes are hexanucleotide expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) and mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), fused in sar- coma (FUS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Together, they explain about 15% of all patients [1\u20133]. The most common neuropathological signature of ALS is cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43, a protein encoded by TARDBP, which is found in more than 95% of ALS cases [7]. TDP-43 inclusions are not unique to patients with mutations in TARDBP, but are also present in patients with C9orf72 expansions or with TBK1 mutations and in patients with sporadic ALS (sALS). TDP-43 is predominantly localized to the nucleus under basal conditions, but in ALS it mis- localizes to the cytoplasm to form aggregates and become phosphorylated. Other aggregating proteins, such as SOD1 and FUS, are found in patients bearing SOD1 and FUS mutations, respectively. Patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions have accu- mulations of dipeptide repeat proteins which are translated from the GGGGCC repeats, although this repeat is located in a non-coding region of the gene.

Recently, new simpli\ufb01ed diagnostic criteria for ALS have been proposed, requiring only combined UMN and LMN dysfunction in one body region, or LMN dysfunction in at least two regions [11]. Whether this will reduce the diagnostic delay requires further study.

The inci- dence amounts to 4\u20138 per 100 000 persons per year in the age group with the highest risk of developing ALS (45\u201375 years). Mean age at onset of symptoms is vari- able: 58\u201363 years for sALS and 40\u201360 years for famil- ial ALS (fALS) [14]. An estimation of the cumulative lifetime risk for developing ALS is 1:350 in men and 1:400 in women [17,18]. Men have a higher risk of developing sporadic limb onset ALS compared to women; the global sex ratio is 1.2\u20131.5 [19]. Aetiology Similar to other neurodegenerative conditions, ALS is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic fac- tors, environmental factors and aging-related dysfunc- tion. At the genetic level, more than 20 genes have been linked with the disease to date, and it is antici- pated that more genetic factors will be discovered. The genetic architecture of ALS appears complex, where monogenetic mutations with high e\ufb00ect size currently explain about 15% of patients, but where common and rare genetic variants with low and mod- erate e\ufb00ect size seem to contribute to the risk of developing ALS as well.

Rarely, patients carry mutations in more than one of these genes, suggesting that ALS can be oli- gogenic in origin [31].

Pathogenesis The neuropathological signature of ALS is character- ized by loss of the neuromuscular connection, axonal retraction and subsequent cell death of UMNs and LMNs, surrounded by astrogliosis and microgliosis, with ubiquitin-positive inclusions being observed in sur- viving neurons. TDP-43 is the main component of these inclusions in more than 95% of ALS patients [7]. TDP- 43 is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein involved in multiple processes such as transcription, splicing, micro RNA maturation, RNA transport and stress granule formation.

    "text": "Mislocalization to the cytoplasm, leading to nuclear depletion of TDP-43 along with cytoplasmic protein aggregation, is a hallmark of ALS [38]. Multiple molecular pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS, such as failure of proteostasis, excitotoxicity, neuroin\ufb02ammation, mitochondrial dys- function and oxidative stress, oligodendrocyte dysfunc- tion, cytoskeletal disturbances and axonal transport defects, disturbed RNA metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic transport de\ufb01cits and impaired DNA repair [2,39]. Interestingly, many of the genes associated with ALS appear to cluster in key pathways: protein quality con- trol and degradation, RNA metabolism, and cytoskele- tal and axonal transport (Fig. 1). Failure of proteostasis Protein aggregates or, more likely, their oligomeric complex precursors disturb normal protein homeosta- sis and induce cellular stress. Molecular chaperones can aid in refolding misfolded proteins, but when the cell is overloaded with misfolded proteins they will be targeted for degradation after ubiquitination via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system. Alternatively, protein aggregates can also undergo lysosomal degradation by the autophagy pathway after binding to p62 (se- questosome 1). Multiple ALS-related genes support an important role for protein aggregation and impaired degradation as key factors in ALS pathogenesis. Indeed, ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) has a role in the delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome [40]. Several other muta- tions are found in genes involved in cargo recognition for the autophagy pathway, as they encode proteins that interact with the ubiquitinated cargo and the pha- gophore membrane: SQSTM1 (encoding the protein p62, which targets ubiquitinated proteins to the phagophore) [41], optineurin (OPTN, functioning as a receptor for autophagy) [42], TBK1 (activates OPTN by phosphorylation) [29], valosin-containing protein (VCP) [43] and the C9orf72 protein [44]. Disturbed RNA metabolism A remarkable number of RNA-binding proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. Identi\ufb01cation of mutations in the genes of two related RNA-binding pro- teins TDP-43 and FUS has introduced the mechanism of dysregulation of RNA metabolism to ALS [45]. Additional mutations in other RNA-binding proteins such as angiogenin (ANG), senataxin (STX), matrin-3 (MATR3), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A1 (hnRNPA1) and A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), and ataxin-2 (ATXN2) further support the notion that disrupted RNA metabolism probably plays an important role in ALS [46]. Under normal conditions, these proteins reside predominantly in the nucleus, where they serve impor- tant functions in transcription, splicing, non-coding RNA metabolism and micro RNA biogenesis. Hence, nuclear depletion can be detrimental and induce gross transcriptome abnormalities. Mislocalization to the cytoplasm with aggregation may induce toxicity as well. Cytoskeletal disturbances and axonal transport defects Several genetic factors in ALS point toward the importance of cytoskeletal integrity and axonal trans- port [47]: pro\ufb01lin-1 (PFN1) and tubulin alpha-4A (TUBA4A) mutations only rarely cause ALS but were found to destabilize the tubulin network and cause axonal transport de\ufb01cits.",

European Journal of Neurology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of Neurology ALS: A CLINICAL REVIEW 1921 muscle cramps and slowness of movements with mus- cle sti\ufb00ness. The onset of muscle weakness in ALS is usually focal and typically spreads to adjacent body regions. This pattern is compatible with spreading of disease pathology within the motor system, with neu- roanatomic propagation within the spinal cord seg- ments and the motor cortex [52]. The disease usually presents with unilateral distal muscle weakness and atrophy in upper or lower limb muscles (spinal ALS, roughly in two-thirds of patients) or in bulbar muscles (bulbar ALS, in about one-third of patients). Upper limb onset is most com- monly in the dominant hand [53], with thenar muscles being more a\ufb00ected than hypothenar muscles (which is referred to as the split-hand syndrome) [54], with early involvement of the \ufb01rst interosseous muscle and \ufb01nger extensors more a\ufb00ected than \ufb01nger \ufb02exors [55]. In the lower limb the anterior tibial muscle is typically a\ufb00ected earlier in the disease course than the gastroc- nemius muscle, the hamstrings before the quadriceps muscles [56]. Bulbar onset ALS presents most commonly with dysarthria or dysphagia, less commonly with dyspho- nia, or reduced mouth closure or chewing problems. Axial muscle weakness with head drop and problems with posture are common in later stages of the dis- ease, but rarely can be the presenting symptom. In about one-third of patients, there can be bouts of uncontrolled laughing or crying (referred to as a pseu- dobulbar a\ufb00ect) [57]. In some patients, the muscle weakness is preceded by a period in which fasciculations, muscle cramps or mild weight loss has been noted. On neurological examination, a combination of signs of UMN and LMN involvement is found in patients with classic ALS. Signs of LMN involvement include muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations and reduced muscle tone. Signs of UMN involvement to look for include hyperre\ufb02exia (or retained re\ufb02exes in atrophic muscles), increased muscle tone (especially in upper limb \ufb02exors and lower limb extensors) and slowness of movements (e.g. of tongue movement). Although the majority of patients can be labelled as having a classic ALS phenotype with spinal or bulbar onset, it is increasingly recognized that ALS is clini- cally a heterogeneous syndrome with distinct motor and extra-motor manifestations (Fig.",

There is con- siderable heterogeneity within the motor manifesta- tions of the disease itself and the motor manifestations can be accompanied by variable degrees of frontotemporal involvement. This results in di\ufb00erent phenotypic presentations of the disease which have di\ufb00erent disease trajectories. Although no widely accepted clinical criteria for the di\ufb00erent ALS phenotypes exist, there is a growing need for a new classi\ufb01cation system using universally accepted terms to account for the disease heterogeneity in ALS [58]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes Many di\ufb00erent motor phenotypes of ALS exist and they are mainly classi\ufb01ed based on the relative UMN versus LMN involvement and the regional distribution of involvement (Fig. 2) [3,58]. It is important to rec- ognize the di\ufb00erent motor phenotypes, as life expec- tancy varies considerably between subtypes of ALS [59]. In addition, variable degrees of cognitive and behavioural impairment can be present. Subtypes of ALS based on relative UMN versus LMN involvement In classic ALS, signs of combined UMN and LMN loss are present in one or more body regions and most patients presenting with a motor neuron disease can be labelled as classic ALS. Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is characterized by progressive spasticity and slowing of movements with isolated UMN signs on clinical examination. There should be no muscle atrophy or visible fasciculations, and no signs of denervation on electromyography (EMG) 4 years from symptom onset [60]. Most com- monly, the symptoms begin symmetrically in the lower limbs but can begin in the bulbar region as well. PLS represents 3%\u20135% of all motor neuron diseases. PLS can evolve into ALS, typically within 3\u20134 years after disease onset. The median survival of PLS patients is more than 20 years. Patients with UMN predominant ALS display some features of LMN involvement but much less pronounced than the UMN features. They have a shorter survival compared to PLS, but a slower",

Pseudobulbar palsy is characterized by absent facial expressions (expressionless face), spastic dysarthria, and di\ufb03culty in chewing, dysphagia and tongue pro- trusion due to spasticity, but no tongue fasciculation or wasting [61].

Bulbar symptoms develop in up to 77%. There is a high male preponderance (male to female ratio 3:1) [62].

Introduc\u019f on Motor Neuron Diseases (MNDs) are a group of progressive disorders that are invariably fatal and affect the motor system, involving the upper, lower motor neurons, or both. The most common entity under the umbrella of MNDs is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, with pathology spanning the primary motor cortex, corticospinal tracts, brainstem and spinal cord, and causing diffuse muscle weakness, atrophy, spasticity and eventually death, typically due to respiratory failure. Other, less common subtypes of MND include Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA), which affects only the lower motor neurons; Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS), which affects only the upper motor neurons; and Progressive Bulbar Palsy (PBP), which involves both upper and lower motor neurons but remains con\ufb01 ned to bulbar muscles (i.e. brainstem centers responsible for facial movements, swallowing, speech, chewing and breathing). MNDs also include hereditary diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Spinal- Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA), etc. This review will focus mainly on ALS.1 The incidence of ALS is estimated to be 1.7 cases per 100,000 per year,2 with the cumulative lifetime risk of developing the disease by age 75 being approximately 1:1000.3 The median age of onset is approximately 64 years for men and 67 for women with the male to female ratio estimated to be 1.8:1.4 ALS is associated with a family history in approximately 10-20% of cases. Familial ALS (FALS) is de\ufb01 ned as the presence of a \ufb01 rst degree relative also affected by the disease and most commonly follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Disease Variants While ALS is typi\ufb01 ed by the combination of both upper and lower motor dysfunction without sensory or cognitive disturbances, there are distinct variants of ALS that do not follow this pattern. Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) is a lower motor neuron only variant of ALS. These patients have progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, but not the hyperre\ufb02 exia, spasticity, and slowness typical of ALS. Many, though not all, patients with PMA eventually develop the UMN signs and symptoms. It is this variant that symptomatically overlaps most closely with multifocal motor neuropathy, a treatable ALS mimic. Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is an upper motor neuron variant. These patients have severe spasticity, hyperre\ufb02 exia, slowness, but do not have the muscle atrophy and weakness. Central nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis, strokes, and other structural lesions can give a similar presentation and are typically excluded by MRI imaging. Some of these patients do develop LMN signs and symptoms and more typical ALS. Frontotemporal Dementia with ALS (FTD/ALS): A variant of ALS that suggests a hereditary disease is Frontotemporal Dementia with ALS (FTD/ALS). Patients develop a dementia syndrome distinguished by prominent deterioration in language and behavior, concomitant with, and occasionally years preceding the typical ALS motor symptoms (see \u201cUnravelling the Mysteries of Frontotemporal Dementia\u201d by Ghoshal and Cairns).7 Unlike Alzheimer\u2019s disease, memory is typically preserved early in the course /ntrinsic \u015a\u0102nd musc\u016fe \u0102trop\u015a\u01c7 common\u016f\u01c7 seen in \u0004>S p\u0102\u019f ents\u0358 SCIENCE OF MEDICINE Missouri Medicine | September/October 2013| 110:5 | 419 of dementia.

Testing for patients with suspected ALS typically consists of electrodiagnostic tests (electromyography [EMG] and nerve conduction studies [NCS]), MRI brain imaging, and laboratory testing (See ). Imaging Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used to exclude any structural lesions that could potentially account for the patient\u2019s presentation. Cervical spine disease with wasting and weakness in the arms or hands at the level of the lesion and spasticity in the legs typically is the most important condition to exclude. For presentations with speech abnormalities, excluding structural lesions (e.g., stroke) with brain MRI is important.

Elevation of hepatic enzymes to three to \ufb01 ve times the upper limit of normal can occur but is typically self-limited and transient.10 It is generally recommended to monitor liver enzymes at one week, one month and every six months after the initiation of riluzole, and to stop the drug if liver enzymes are elevated to more than \ufb01 ve times the upper limit of normal. Riluzole typically is given at 50 mg twice per day.

At the \ufb01 rst signs of dysphagia, a swallowing study should be obtained by a speech pathologist. A change in diet to soft consistency, high caloric foods may initially ameliorate the problem, but in many ALS cases, oral intake becomes insuf\ufb01 cient. Supplementation, via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), is often required. PEG placement in ALS patients results in the stabilization, and occasionally partial regain, of weight15 and may prolong survival 16. In discussing PEG tube it is important to emphasize that that oral feeding does not have to completely stop. The decision for a PEG placement should be made early in the course of the disease as restricted pulmonary function (FVC<50%) increases the chances of procedure-related complications.17 Sia\u016f\u017drr\u015aea Sialorrhea and drooling in ALS is not related to saliva overproduction, but results from an inability to adequately handle and swallow saliva.
